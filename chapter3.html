<div id="section3-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Situation</h2>
<p>In Chapter <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a>, tools for comparing the means of two groups
were considered. More generally, these methods are used for a quantitative
response and a categorical explanatory variable (group) which had two and only
two levels. The full prisoner rating data set actually contained three groups
(Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-1">3.1</a>) with <em>Beautiful</em>, <em>Average</em>, and <em>Unattractive</em>
rated pictures randomly assigned to the subjects for sentence ratings. In a
situation with more than two groups, we have two choices. First, we could rely
on our two group comparisons, performing tests for every possible pair
(<em>Beautiful</em> vs <em>Average</em>, <em>Beautiful</em> vs <em>Unattractive</em>, and <em>Average</em> vs
<em>Unattractive</em>). We spent Chapter <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a> doing inferences for differences
between <em>Average</em> and <em>Unattractive</em>. The other two comparisons would lead us to
initially end up with three p-values and no direct answer about our initial
question of interest – is there some overall difference in the average sentences
provided across the groups? In this chapter, we will learn a new method, called
<strong><em>Analysis of Variance</em></strong>, <strong><em>ANOVA</em></strong>, or sometimes <strong><em>AOV</em></strong> that directly assesses whether there is
evidence of some overall difference in the means among the groups. This version
of an ANOVA is called a <strong><em>One-Way ANOVA</em></strong> since there is just
one<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> grouping variable. After we perform our One-Way ANOVA test for
overall evidence of a difference, we will revisit the comparisons similar to those
considered in Chapter <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a> to get more details on specific differences
among <em>all</em> the pairs of groups – what we call <strong><em>pair-wise comparisons</em></strong>.
An issue is created when you perform many tests simultaneously and we will augment
our previous methods with an adjusted method for pairwise comparisons to make our
results valid called <strong><em>Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference</em></strong>.</p>
<p>To make this more concrete, we return to the original MockJury data, making
side-by-side boxplots and beanplots (Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-1">3.1</a>) as well as
summarizing the suggested sentence lengths by the three groups using <code>favstats</code>.</p>

<p>There are slight differences in the sample sizes in the three groups with <span class="math inline">\(37\)</span>
<em>Unattractive</em>, <span class="math inline">\(38\)</span> <em>Average</em> and <span class="math inline">\(39\)</span> <em>Beautiful</em> group responses, providing a
data set has a total sample size of <span class="math inline">\(N=114\)</span>. The <em>Beautiful</em> and <em>Average</em> groups
do not appear to be very different with means of 4.33 and 3.97 years. In
Chapter <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a>, we found moderate evidence regarding the difference in
<em>Average</em> and <em>Unattractive</em>. It is less clear whether we might find evidence of a
difference between <em>Beautiful</em> and <em>Unattractive</em> groups since we are comparing
means of 5.81 and 4.33 years. All the distributions appear to be right skewed
with relatively similar shapes. The variability in <em>Average</em> and <em>Unattractive</em>
groups seems like it could be slightly different leading to an overall concern of
whether the variability is the same in all the groups.</p>

<div id="section3-2" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Linear model for One-Way ANOVA (cell-means and reference-coding)</h2>
<p>We introduced the statistical model <span class="math inline">\(y_{ij} = \mu_j+\varepsilon_{ij}\)</span> in
Chapter <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a> for the situation with <span class="math inline">\(j = 1 \text{ or } 2\)</span> to denote
a situation where there were two groups and, for the model that is consistent
with the alternative hypothesis, the means differed. Now we have three groups
and the previous model can be extended to this new situation by allowing <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>
to be 1, 2, or 3. Now that we have more than two groups, we need to admit that
what we were doing in Chapter <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a> was actually fitting what is called
a <strong><em>linear model</em></strong>.

The linear model assumes that the responses follow a normal
distribution with the linear model defining the mean, all observations have the
same variance, and the parameters for the mean in the model enter linearly. This
last condition is hard to explain at this level of material – it is sufficient
to know that there are models where the parameters enter the model nonlinearly and
that they are beyond the scope of this function and this material. By employing a general modeling methodology, we will be able to use the same general modeling framework for the methods
in Chapters <a href="chapter3.html#chapter3">3</a>, <a href="chapter4.html#chapter4">4</a>, <a href="chapter6.html#chapter6">6</a>,
<a href="chapter7.html#chapter7">7</a>, and <a href="chapter8.html#chapter8">8</a>.</p>
<p>As in Chapter <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a>, we have a null hypothesis that defines a
situation (and model) where all the groups have the same mean. Specifically,
the <strong><em>null hypothesis</em></strong> in the general situation with <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> groups
(<span class="math inline">\(J\ge 2\)</span>) is to have all the <span class="math inline">\(\underline{\text{true}}\)</span> group means equal,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_0:\mu_1 = \ldots = \mu_J.\]</span></p>
<p>This defines a model where all the groups have the same mean so it can be
defined in terms of a single mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, for the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> observation from
the <span class="math inline">\(j^{th}\)</span> group as <span class="math inline">\(y_{ij} = \mu+\varepsilon_{ij}\)</span>. This is not the model
that most researchers want to be the final description of their study as it
implies no difference in the groups. There is more caution required to specify
the alternative hypothesis with more than two groups. The
<strong><em>alternative hypothesis</em></strong> needs to be the logical negation of this null
hypothesis of all groups having equal means; to make the null hypothesis
false, we only need one group to differ but more than one group could differ
from the others. Essentially, there are many ways to “violate” the null
hypothesis so we choose some delicate wording for the alternative hypothesis
when there are more than 2 groups. Specifically, we state the alternative as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_A: \text{ Not all } \mu_j \text{ are equal}\]</span></p>
<p>or, in words, <strong>at least one of the true means differs among the J groups</strong>.
You will be attracted to trying to say that all means are different in the
alternative but we do not put this strict a requirement in place to reject the
null hypothesis. The alternative model

allows all the true group means to
differ but does require that they differ with</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_{ij} = {\color{red}{\mu_j}}+\varepsilon_{ij}.\]</span></p>
<p>This linear model

states that the response for the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> observation in
the <span class="math inline">\(j^{th}\)</span> group, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{y_{ij}}\)</span>, is modeled with a group <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>
(<span class="math inline">\(j=1, \ldots, J\)</span>) population mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_j\)</span>, and a random error for each subject
in each group <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{ij}\)</span>, that we assume follows a normal distribution and
that all the random errors have the same variance, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. We can write the assumption about the random errors, often called the <strong><em>normality assumption</em></strong>,
as <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{ij} \sim N(0,\sigma^2)\)</span>. There is a second way to write out this
model that allows extension to more complex models discussed below, so we
need a name for this version of the model. The model written in terms of the
<span class="math inline">\({\color{red}{\mu_j}}\text{&#39;s}\)</span> is called the
<b><font color='red'>cell means model</font></b> and is the
easier version of this model to understand.
</p>
<p>One of the reasons we learned about beanplots is that
it helps us visually consider all the aspects of this model.

In the right panel of Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-1">3.1</a>,
we can see the wider, bold horizontal lines that provide the estimated group means.
The bigger the differences in the sample means, the more likely we are to find
evidence against the null hypothesis. You can also see the null model on the plot
that assumes all the groups have the same mean as displayed in the
dashed horizontal line
at 4.7 years (the R code below shows the overall mean of <em>Years</em> is 4.7). While
the hypotheses focus on the means, the model also contains assumptions about the
distribution of the responses – specifically that the distributions are normal
and that all the groups have the same variability.

As discussed previously, it
appears that the distributions are right skewed and the variability might not be
the same for all the groups. The boxplot provides the information about the skew
and variability but since it doesn’t display the means it is not directly related
to the linear model and hypotheses we are considering.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">mean</span>(MockJury<span class="op">$</span>Years)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4.692982</code></pre>
<p>There is a second way to write out the One-Way ANOVA model

that provides a framework
for extensions to more complex models described in Chapter <a href="chapter4.html#chapter4">4</a> and
beyond. The other <strong><em>parameterization</em></strong> (way of writing out or defining) of the
model is called the <b><font color='purple'>reference-coded model</font></b> since it
writes out the model in terms of a


<strong><em>baseline group</em></strong> and deviations from that baseline or reference level. The
reference-coded model for the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> subject in the <span class="math inline">\(j^{th}\)</span> group is
<span class="math inline">\(y_{ij} ={\color{purple}{\boldsymbol{\alpha + \tau_j}}}+\varepsilon_{ij}\)</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(\color{purple}{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}\)</span> (alpha) is the true mean for the
baseline group (first alphabetically) and the <span class="math inline">\(\color{purple}{\boldsymbol{\tau_j}}\)</span>
(tau <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>) are the deviations from the baseline group for group <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. The deviation
for the baseline group, <span class="math inline">\(\color{purple}{\boldsymbol{\tau_1}}\)</span>, is always set to 0
so there are really just deviations for groups 2 through <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span>. The equivalence
between the two models can be seen by considering the mean for the first, second,
and <span class="math inline">\(J^{th}\)</span> groups in both models:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{lccc}
&amp; \textbf{Cell means:} &amp;&amp; \textbf{Reference-coded:}\\
\textbf{Group } 1: &amp; \color{red}{\mu_1} &amp;&amp; \color{purple}{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} \\
\textbf{Group } 2: &amp; \color{red}{\mu_2} &amp;&amp; \color{purple}{\boldsymbol{\alpha + \tau_2}} \\
\ldots &amp; \ldots &amp;&amp; \ldots \\
\textbf{Group } J: &amp; \color{red}{\mu_J} &amp;&amp; \color{purple}{\boldsymbol{\alpha +\tau_J}}
\end{array}\]</span></p>
<p>The hypotheses for the reference-coded model are similar to those in the
cell-means coding except that they are defined in terms of the deviations,
<span class="math inline">\({\color{purple}{\boldsymbol{\tau_j}}}\)</span>. The null hypothesis is that there is
no deviation from the baseline for any group – that all the <span class="math inline">\({\color{purple}{\boldsymbol{\tau_j\text{&#39;s}}}}=0\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\boldsymbol{H_0: \tau_2=\ldots=\tau_J=0}.\]</span></p>
<p>The alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the deviations is not 0,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\boldsymbol{H_A:} \textbf{ Not all } \boldsymbol{\tau_j} \textbf{ equal } \bf{0}.\]</span></p>
<p>In this chapter, you are welcome to use either version (unless we instruct you
otherwise) but we have to use the reference-coding in subsequent chapters. The
next task is to learn how to use R’s linear model, <code>lm</code>, function to get
estimates of the parameters in each model, but first a quick review of these
new ideas:</p>

</p></li>
<li><p>Alternative hypothesis in words: At least one of the true deviations is
different from 0 or that at least one group has a different true mean than the
baseline group.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternative model: <span class="math inline">\(y_{ij} =\color{purple}{\boldsymbol{\alpha + \tau_j}}+\varepsilon_{ij}\)</span> </p></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to estimate the models discussed above, the <code>lm</code> function is used<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a>. The <code>lm</code> function continues to
use the same format as previous functions, <code>lm(Y~X, data=datasetname)</code>.
It ends up that this code will give you the reference-coded version of the
model by default (The developers of R thought it was that important!).


We want to start with the
cell-means version of the model,

so we have to override the standard technique
and add a “<code>-1</code>” to the formula interface to tell R that we want to the
cell-means coding. Generally, this looks like <code>lm(Y~X-1, data=datasetname).</code>

Once we fit a model in R, the <code>summary</code> function run on the model provides a
useful “summary” of the model coefficients and a suite of other potentially
interesting information. For the moment, we will focus on the estimated model
coefficients, so only those lines are output. When fitting this version
of the One-Way ANOVA model,
you will find a row of output for each group relating the <span class="math inline">\(\mu_j\text{&#39;s}\)</span>.
The output contains columns for an estimate (<code>Estimate</code>), standard error
(<code>Std. Error</code>), <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-value (<code>t value</code>), and p-value (<code>Pr(&gt;|t|)</code>). We’ll
learn to use all the output in the following material, but for now just focus
on the estimates of the parameters that the function provides in the first
column (“Estimate”) of the coefficient table.</p>

<p>In general, we denote estimated parameters with a hat over the parameter of
interest to show that it is an estimate. For the true mean of group <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(\mu_j\)</span>, we estimate it with <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mu}_j\)</span>, which is just the sample mean for group
<span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_j\)</span>. The model suggests an estimate for each observation that we denote
as <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}_{ij}\)</span> that we will also call a <strong><em>fitted value</em></strong> based on the model
being considered. The
same estimate is used for all observations in the each group. R tries to help you to
sort out which row of output corresponds to which group by appending the group name
with the variable name. Here, the variable name was <code>Attr</code> and the first group
alphabetically was <em>Beautiful</em>, so R provides a row labeled <code>AttrBeautiful</code>
with an estimate of 4.3333. The sample means from the three groups can be seen to
directly match for that group and the other two.</p>

<p>The reference-coded version of the same model is more complicated but ends up

giving the same results once we understand what it is doing. It uses a different
parameterization to accomplish this, so has different model output. Here is the model

for <em>Beautiful</em>, 2 for <em>Average</em>, and 3 for <em>Unattractive</em>. The way you can figure
out the baseline group (group 1 is <em>Beautiful</em> here) is to see which category label
is <em>not present</em> in the output. <strong>The baseline level is typically the first group

there are interpretations available for each coefficient. For <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\alpha} = 4.333\)</span> years, this is an estimate of the mean sentencing time for the <em>Beautiful</em> group.
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\tau}_2 =-0.3596\)</span> years is the deviation of the <em>Average</em> group’s mean from
the <em>Beautiful</em> group’s mean (specifically, it is <span class="math inline">\(0.36\)</span> years lower). Finally,
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\tau}_3=1.4775\)</span> years tells us that the <em>Unattractive</em> group mean sentencing
time is 1.48 years higher than the <em>Beautiful</em> group mean sentencing time. These
interpretations lead directly to
reconstructing the estimated means for each group by combining the baseline and
pertinent deviations as shown in Table <a href="chapter3.html#tab:Table3-1">3.1</a>.</p>

<p>We can also visualize the results of our linear models using what are called

(from the <code>effects</code> package; <span class="citation">(Fox et al. <a href="#ref-R-effects" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>)

as displayed in Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-2">3.2</a>. We don’t want to use the word
“effect” for these model components unless we have random assignment in the study

design so we generically call these <strong><em>term-plots</em></strong> as they display terms or
components from the model in hopefully useful ways to aid in model interpretation
even in the presence of complicated model parameterizations. Specifically, these
plots take an estimated model and show you its estimates along with 95% confidence
intervals generated by the linear model. To make this plot, you need to install and
load the <code>effects</code> package and then use <code>plot(allEffects(...))</code> functions
together on the <code>lm</code> object called <code>lm2</code> that was estimated above. You can
find the correspondence between the displayed means and the estimates that were
constructed in Table <a href="chapter3.html#tab:Table3-1">3.1</a>.

<p>In order to assess evidence for having different means for the groups, we will
compare either of the previous models (cell-means or reference-coded) to a null
model based on the null hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_0: \mu_1 = \ldots = \mu_J\)</span>) which implies a
model of <span class="math inline">\(\color{red}{y_{ij} = \mu+\varepsilon_{ij}}\)</span> in the cell-means version
where <span class="math inline">\({\color{red}{\mu}}\)</span> is a common mean for all the observations. We will call
this the <b><font color='red'>mean-only</font></b> model since it only has a single mean
in it. In the reference-coded version of the model, we have a null hypothesis that
<span class="math inline">\(H_0: \tau_2 = \ldots = \tau_J = 0\)</span>, so the “mean-only” model is

<span class="math inline">\(\color{purple}{y_{ij} =\boldsymbol{\alpha}+\varepsilon_{ij}}\)</span> with
<span class="math inline">\(\color{purple}{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}\)</span> having the same definition as
<span class="math inline">\(\color{red}{\mu}\)</span> for the cell means model – it forces a common value for the
mean for all the groups. Moving from the <em>reference-coded</em> model to the <em>mean-only</em>
model is also an example of a situation where we move from a “full” model


to a
“reduced” model by setting some coefficients in the “full” model to 0 and, by doing
this, get a simpler or “reduced” model.

Simple models can be good as they are easier
to interpret, but having a model for <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> groups that suggests no difference in the
groups is not a very exciting result
in most, but not all, situations<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a>. In order for R to provide
results for the mean-only model, we remove the grouping variable, <code>Attr</code>, from
the model formula and just include a “1”. The <code>(Intercept)</code> row of the output
provides the estimate for the mean-only model as a reduced model from either the
cell-means or reference-coded models when we assume that the mean is the same
for all groups:</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> One-Way ANOVA Sums of Squares, Mean Squares, and F-test</h2>
<p>The previous discussion showed two ways of parameterizing models for the
One-Way ANOVA model and getting estimates from output but still hasn’t
addressed how to assess evidence related to whether the observed differences
in the means among the groups is “real”. In this section, we develop what is
called the <strong><em>ANOVA F-test</em></strong>

that provides a method of aggregating the
differences among the means of 2 or more groups and testing our null hypothesis
of no difference in the means vs the alternative. In order to develop the test,
some additional notation is needed. The sample size in each group is denoted
<span class="math inline">\(n_j\)</span> and the total sample size is
<span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{N=\Sigma n_j = n_1 + n_2 + \ldots + n_J}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>
(capital sigma) means “add up over whatever follows”. An estimated
<strong><em>residual</em></strong> (<span class="math inline">\(e_{ij}\)</span>) is the difference between an observation, <span class="math inline">\(y_{ij}\)</span>,
and the model estimate, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}_{ij} = \hat{\mu}_j\)</span>, for that observation,
<span class="math inline">\(y_{ij}-\hat{y}_{ij} = e_{ij}\)</span>. It is basically what is left over that the mean
part of the model (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mu}_{j}\)</span>) does not explain. It is also a window
into how “good” the model might be because it reflects what the model was unable to explain.</p>
<p>Consider the four different fake results for a situation with four groups (<span class="math inline">\(J=4\)</span>)
displayed in Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-3">3.3</a>. Which of the different results shows
the most and least evidence of differences in the means? In trying to answer
this, think about both how different the means are (obviously important) and
how variable the results are around the mean. These situations were created to
have the same means in Scenarios 1 and 2 as well as matching means in Scenarios
3 and 4. The variability around the means matches by shading (lighter or
darker). In Scenarios 1 and 2, the differences in the means is smaller than in
the other two results. But Scenario 2 should provide more evidence of what
little difference in present than Scenario 1 because it has less variability
around the means. The best situation for finding group differences here is
Scenario 4 since it has the largest difference in the means and the least
variability around those means. Our test statistic somehow needs to allow a
comparison of the variability in the means to the overall variability to help
us get results that reflect that Scenario 4 has the strongest evidence of a
difference and Scenario 1 would have the least.</p>

</div>
<p>The statistic that allows the comparison of relative amounts of variation is called
the <strong><em>ANOVA F-statistic</em></strong>. It is developed using <strong><em>sums of squares</em></strong>

which are measures of total variation like those that are used in the numerator of the
standard deviation (<span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1^N(y_i-\bar{y})^2\)</span>) that took all the observations,
subtracted the mean, squared the differences, and then added up the results
over all the observations to generate a measure of total variability. With
multiple groups, we will focus on decomposing that total variability
(<strong><em>Total Sums of Squares</em></strong>) into variability among the means (we’ll call this
<strong><em>Explanatory Variable</em></strong> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\textbf{&#39;s}\)</span> <strong><em>Sums of Squares</em></strong>) and
variability in the residuals 
or errors (<strong><em>Error Sums of Squares</em></strong>). We define each of these quantities in
the One-Way ANOVA situation as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\textbf{SS}_{\textbf{Total}} =\)</span> Total Sums of Squares
<span class="math inline">\(= \Sigma^J_{j=1}\Sigma^{n_j}_{i=1}(y_{ij}-\bar{\bar{y}})^2\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is the total variation in the responses around the overall or
<strong><em>grand mean</em></strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\bar{\bar{y}}\)</span>, the estimated mean for all the
observations and available from the mean-only model).</p></li>
<li><p>By summing over all <span class="math inline">\(n_j\)</span> observations in each group, <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^{n_j}_{i=1}(\ )\)</span>,
and then adding those results up across the groups, <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^J_{j=1}(\ )\)</span>,
we accumulate the variation across all <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> observations.</p></li>
<li><p>Note: this is the residual variation if the null model is used, so there
is no further decomposition possible for that model.</p></li>
<li><p>This is also equivalent to the numerator of the sample variance,
<span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^{N}_{1}(y_{i}-\bar{y})^2\)</span> which is what you get when you ignore
the information on the potential differences in the groups.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\textbf{SS}_{\textbf{A}} =\)</span> Explanatory Variable <em>A</em>’s Sums of Squares
<span class="math inline">\(=\Sigma^J_{j=1}\Sigma^{n_j}_{i=1}(\bar{y}_{j}-\bar{\bar{y}})^2 =\Sigma^J_{j=1}n_j(\bar{y}_{j}-\bar{\bar{y}})^2\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is the variation in the group means around the grand mean based on
the explanatory variable <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Also called sums of squares for the treatment, regression, or model.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\textbf{SS}_\textbf{E} =\)</span> Error (Residual) Sums of Squares
<span class="math inline">\(=\Sigma^J_{j=1}\Sigma^{n_j}_{i=1}(y_{ij}-\bar{y}_j)^2 =\Sigma^J_{j=1}\Sigma^{n_j}_{i=1}(e_{ij})^2\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is the variation in the responses around the group means.</p></li>
<li><p>Also called the sums of squares for the residuals, with the second
version of the formula showing that it is just the squared residuals added
up across all the observations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The possibly surprising result given the mass of notation just presented is that
the total sums of squares is <strong>ALWAYS</strong> equal to the sum of explanatory variable
<span class="math inline">\(A\text{&#39;s}\)</span> sum of squares and the error sums of squares,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\textbf{SS}_{\textbf{Total}} \mathbf{=} \textbf{SS}_\textbf{A} \mathbf{+} \textbf{SS}_\textbf{E}.\]</span></p>
<p>This result is called the <strong><em>sums of squares decomposition formula</em></strong>.

The equality means that if the <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{SS}_\textbf{A}\)</span> goes up, then the
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{SS}_\textbf{E}\)</span> must go down if <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{SS}_{\textbf{Total}}\)</span> remains
the same. We use these results to build our test statistic and organize this information in
what is called an <strong><em>ANOVA table</em></strong>.

The ANOVA table is generated using the
<code>anova</code> function applied to the reference-coded model, <code>lm2</code>:

<p>It may be easiest to understand the <em>sums of squares decomposition</em> by connecting
it to our permutation ideas.


In a permutation situation, the total variation
(<span class="math inline">\(SS_\text{Total}\)</span>) cannot change – it is the same responses varying
around the grand mean. However, the amount of variation attributed to variation
among the means and in the residuals can change if we change which observations go
with which group. In Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-4">3.4</a> (panel a), the means, sums of
squares, and 95% confidence intervals for each mean are displayed for the three
treatment levels from the original prisoner rating data. Three permuted versions
of the data set are summarized in panels (b), (c), and (d). The <span class="math inline">\(\text{SS}_A\)</span> is 70.9
in the real data set and between 3.7 and 27.5 in the permuted data sets.
If you had
to pick among the plots for the one with the most evidence of a difference in the
means, you hopefully would pick panel (a). This visual “unusualness” suggests
that this observed result is unusual relative to the possibilities under
permutations, which are, again, the possibilities tied to having the null
hypothesis being true. But note that the differences here are not that great
between these three permuted data sets and the real one. It is likely that at
least some might have selected panel (d) as also looking like it shows
some evidence of differences (maybe not the most?) as it looks like it
shows some evidence differences.</p>
<p>One way to think about <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{SS}_\textbf{A}\)</span> is that it is a function that
converts the variation in the group means into a single value. This makes it a
reasonable test statistic in a permutation testing context.

By comparing the
observed <span class="math inline">\(\text{SS}_A =\)</span> 70.9 to the permutation results of
20.3, 27.5, and 3.7 we see
that the observed result is much more extreme than the three alternate versions.
In contrast to our previous test statistics where positive and negative
differences were possible, <span class="math inline">\(\text{SS}_A\)</span> is always positive with a value of 0
corresponding to no variation in the means. The larger the <span class="math inline">\(\text{SS}_A\)</span>, the more
variation there is in the means. The permutation p-value for the alternative
hypothesis of <strong>some</strong> (not of greater or less than!) difference in the true
means of the groups will involve counting the number of permuted <span class="math inline">\(SS_A^*\)</span> results
that are as large or larger than what we observed.
</p>
<p>(ref:fig3-4) Plot of means and 95% confidence intervals for the three groups
for the real Mock Jury data (a) and three different permutations of the treatment labels
to the same responses in (b), (c), and (d). Note that <code>SSTotal</code> is always the same
but the different amounts of variation associated with the means (<code>SSA</code>) or the
errors (<code>SSE</code>) changes in permutation.</p>
<p>To do a permutation test,

we need to be able to calculate and extract the
<span class="math inline">\(\text{SS}_A\)</span> value. In the ANOVA table, it is the second number in the first row;
we can use the bracket, <code>[,]</code>, referencing to extract that
number from the ANOVA table that <code>anova</code> produces with
<code>anova(lm(Years~Attr, data=MockJury))[1, 2]</code>. We’ll store the observed value
of <span class="math inline">\(\text{SS}_A\)</span> in <code>Tobs</code>, reusing some ideas from Chapter <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a>.

the observed result is larger than many of the <span class="math inline">\(\text{SS}^*_A\text{&#39;s}\)</span>, there are
also many permuted results that are much larger than observed. The proportion

<p>This provides a permutation-based p-value of 0.067 and suggests marginal evidence
against the null hypothesis of no difference in the true means. We would interpret
this p-value as saying that there is a 6.7% chance of getting a <span class="math inline">\(\text{SS}_A\)</span>
as large or larger than we observed, given that the null hypothesis is true.
</p>
<p>It ends up that some nice parametric statistical results
are available (if our assumptions are met) for the ratio of estimated variances,
the estimated variances are called <strong><em>Mean Squares</em></strong>.

To turn sums of squares into mean square (variance) estimates,
we divide the sums of squares by the amount of free information available. For
example, remember the typical variance estimator introductory statistics,
<span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^N_1(y_i-\bar{y})^2/(N-1)\)</span>? Your instructor spent some time trying various
approaches to explaining why we have a denominator of <span class="math inline">\(N-1\)</span>. The most useful for our
purposes moving forward is that we “lose” one piece of information to estimate
the mean and there are <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> deviations around the single mean so we divide by
<span class="math inline">\(N-1\)</span>. The main point is that the sums of squares were divided by something and
we got an estimator for the variance, here of the observations overall.</p>
<p>Now consider <span class="math inline">\(\text{SS}_E = \Sigma^J_{j=1}\Sigma^{n_j}_{i=1}(y_{ij}-\bar{y}_j)^2\)</span>
which still has <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> deviations but it varies around the <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> means, so the</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\textbf{Mean Square Error} = \text{MS}_E = \text{SS}_E/(N-J).\]</span></p>
<p>Basically, we lose <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> pieces of information in this calculation because we have
to estimate <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> means. The similar calculation of the <strong><em>Mean Square for variable</em></strong> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>
(<span class="math inline">\(\text{MS}_A\)</span>) is harder to see in the formula
(<span class="math inline">\(\text{SS}_A = \Sigma^J_{j=1}n_j(\bar{y}_i-\bar{\bar{y}})^2\)</span>), but the same
reasoning can be used to understand the denominator for forming <span class="math inline">\(\text{MS}_A\)</span>:
there are <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> means that vary around the grand mean so</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{MS}_A = \text{SS}_A/(J-1).\]</span></p>
<p>In summary, the two mean squares are simply:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\text{MS}_A = \text{SS}_A/(J-1)\)</span>, which estimates the variance of the group
means around the grand mean.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\text{MS}_{\text{Error}} = \text{SS}_{\text{Error}}/(N-J)\)</span>, which estimates
the variation of the errors around the group means.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These results are put together using a ratio to define the <strong><em>ANOVA F-statistic</em></strong>
(also called the <strong><em>F-ratio</em></strong>) as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[F=\text{MS}_A/\text{MS}_{\text{Error}}.\]</span></p>
<p>If the variability in the means is “similar” to the variability in the residuals,
the statistic would have a value around 1. If that variability is similar then
there would be no evidence of a difference in the means. If the <span class="math inline">\(\text{MS}_A\)</span> is much
larger than the <span class="math inline">\(\text{MS}_E\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-statistic will provide evidence against
the null hypothesis. The “size” of the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-statistic is formalized by finding the
p-value. The <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-statistic, if assumptions discussed below are met and we assume
the null hypothesis is true, follows what is called an <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-distribution.

The
<strong><em>F-distribution</em></strong> is a right-skewed distribution whose shape is defined by what
are called the <strong><em>numerator degrees of freedom</em></strong> (<span class="math inline">\(J-1\)</span>) and the
<strong><em>denominator degrees of freedom</em></strong> (<span class="math inline">\(N-J\)</span>). These names correspond to the values
that we used to calculate the mean squares and where in the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-ratio each mean
square was used; <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-distributions are denoted by their degrees of freedom using
the convention of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> (<em>numerator df</em>, <em>denominator df</em>). Some examples of
different <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-distributions are displayed for you in Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-6">3.6</a>. </p>
<p>The characteristics of the F-distribution can be summarized as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Right skewed,</p></li>
<li><p>Nonzero probabilities for values greater than 0,</p></li>
<li><p>Its shape changes depending on the <strong>numerator</strong> and <strong>denominator DF</strong>, and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Always use the right-tailed area for p-values.</strong></p></li>

<p>The table is oriented to help you reconstruct the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-ratio from each of its
components. The output from R is similar although it does not provide the last row
and sometimes switches the order of columns in different functions we will use. The R version of the table for the type
of picture effect (<code>Attr</code>) with <span class="math inline">\(J=3\)</span> levels and <span class="math inline">\(N=114\)</span> observations, repeated
from above, is:</p>

<p>The p-value from the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-distribution is 0.067.  We can
verify this result using the observed <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-statistic of 2.77

which follows an <span class="math inline">\(F(2, 111)\)</span> distribution if the null hypothesis is true and some
other assumptions are met.</p>
<p>Using the <code>pf</code> function provides us with areas in the
specified <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-distribution with the <code>df1</code> provided to the function as the

the p-value obtained using permutations with the test statistic of the

potential test statistic to use as a test statistic in a permutation approach,
now that we know about it. We should check that we get similar results from it
with permutations as we did from using <span class="math inline">\(\text{SS}_A\)</span> as a permutation-test test

for the

<p>The permutation-based p-value is 0.062 which, again, matches the other
results closely. The first conclusion is that using a test statistic of either
the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-statistic or the <span class="math inline">\(\text{SS}_A\)</span> provide similar permutation results.
However, we tend to favor using the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-statistic because it is more commonly used
in reporting ANOVA results, not because it is any better in a permutation context.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to compare the permutation distribution for the
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-statistic and the parametric <span class="math inline">\(F(2, 111)\)</span> distribution
(Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-8">3.8</a>). They do not match perfectly but are quite similar.
Some the differences around 0 are due to the behavior of the method used to create
the density curve and are not really a problem for the methods. The similarity in
the two curves explains why both methods give similar results. In some
situations, the correspondence will not be quite so close.</p>

<p>So how can we rectify this result (<span class="math inline">\(\text{p-value}\approx 0.06\)</span>) and the
Chapter <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a> result that detected a difference between <em>Average</em>
and <em>Unattractive</em> with a <span class="math inline">\(\text{p-value}\approx 0.03\)</span>? I selected the two groups
to compare in Chapter <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a> because they were furthest apart.
“Cherry-picking” the comparison that is likely to be most different creates a
false sense of the real situation and inflates the Type I error rate because of
the selection<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a>.


If the entire suite of pairwise comparisons are considered, this
result may lose some of its luster. In other words, if we consider the suite of
three pair-wise differences (and the tests) implicit in comparing all of them,
we may need stronger evidence in the most different pair than a
p-value of 0.033 to suggest overall differences. In this situation,
the <em>Beautiful</em> and <em>Average</em>
groups are not that different from each other so their difference does not
contribute much to the overall <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test. In Section <a href="chapter3.html#section3-6">3.6</a>, we will
revisit this topic and consider a method that is
statistically valid for performing all possible pair-wise comparisons that is also
consistent with our overall test results.</p>

<div id="section3-4" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> ANOVA model diagnostics including QQ-plots</h2>
<p>The requirements for a One-Way ANOVA <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test are similar to those discussed in
Chapter <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a>, except that there are now <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> groups instead of only 2.
Specifically, the linear model assumes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Independent observations</strong>,</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Equal variances</strong>, and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Normal distributions</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For assessing equal variances across the groups, it is best to use plots to assess this. We can use boxplots and beanplots to compare the spreads of the
groups, which were provided in Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-1">3.1</a>. The range and IQRs
should be relatively similar across the groups if you do not find evidence of a
problem with this assumption. You should start with noting how clear or big the
violation of the assumption might be but remember that there will always be some
differences in the variation among groups even if the true variability is exactly
equal in the populations. In addition to our direct plotting, there are some
diagnostic plots available from the <code>lm</code> function that can help us more
clearly assess potential violations of the previous assumptions.
</p>
<p>We can obtain a suite of four diagnostic plots by using the <code>plot</code> function on
any linear model object that we have fit. To get all the plots together in four
panels we need to add the <code>par(mfrow=c(2,2))</code> command to tell R to make a graph
with 4 panels<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a>.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">par</span>(<span class="dt">mfrow=</span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">2</span>,<span class="dv">2</span>))
<span class="kw">plot</span>(lm2, <span class="dt">pch=</span><span class="dv">16</span>)</code></pre>
<p>There are two plots in Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-9">3.9</a> with useful information for assessing the
equal variance assumption. The “Residuals vs Fitted” panel in the top left panel displays the residuals <span class="math inline">\((e_{ij} = y_{ij}-\hat{y}_{ij})\)</span> on the y-axis and the fitted values
<span class="math inline">\((\hat{y}_{ij})\)</span> on the x-axis.

This allows you to see if the variability of the
observations differs across the groups as a function of the mean of the groups,
because all the observations in the same group get the same fitted value – the
mean of the group. In this plot, the points seem to have fairly similar spreads
at the fitted values for the three groups with fitted values of 4, 4.3, and 6.
The “Scale-Location” plot in the lower left panel has the same x-axis but the
y-axis contains the square-root of the absolute value of the standardized
residuals.

The absolute value transforms all the residuals into a magnitude
scale (removing direction) and the square-root helps you see differences in
variability more accurately. The standardization scales the residuals to have a variance
of 1 so help you in other displays to get a sense of how many standard deviations
you are away from the mean in the residual distribution. The visual assessment is
similar in the two plots – you want to consider whether it appears that the
groups have somewhat similar or noticeably different amounts of variability. If
you see a clear funnel shape in the Residuals vs Fitted

or an increase or decrease
in the upper edge of points in the Scale-Location plot that may indicate a
violation of the constant variance assumption.

Remember that some variation
across the groups is expected and is OK, but large differences in spreads are problematic for all the procedures that involve linear models. When discussing
these results, you want to discuss how clearly the differences in variation are
and whether that <em>shows a clear violation of the assumption</em> of equal variance
for all observations. Like in hypothesis testing, you can never prove that you’ve
met assumptions based on a plot “looking OK”, but you can say that there is no
clear evidence that the assumption is violated!

</p>
</div>
<p>The linear model also assumes that all the random errors (<span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{ij}\)</span>) follow a
normal distribution. To gain insight into the validity of this assumption, we
can explore the original observations as displayed in the beanplots, mentally
subtracting off the differences in the means and focusing on the shapes of the
distributions of observations in each group. These plots are especially good for
assessing whether there is a skew or outliers present in each group.   If so,
by definition, the normality assumption is violated. But our assumption is
about the distribution of all the errors after removing the differences
in the means and so we want an overall assessment technique to understand how
reasonable our assumption is overall for our model. The residuals from the entire

model provide us with estimates of the random errors and if the normality
assumption is met, then the residuals all-together should approximately follow a
normal distribution. The <strong><em>Normal Q-Q Plot</em></strong> in the upper right panel of
Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-9">3.9</a> is a direct visual assessment of how well our
residuals match what we would expect from a normal distribution. Outliers, skew,
heavy and light-tailed aspects of distributions (all violations of normality)
show up in this plot once you learn to read it – which is our next task. To
make it easier to read QQ-plots, it is nice to start with just considering
histograms and/or density plots of the residuals and to see how that maps into
this new display. We can obtain the residuals from the linear model using the
<code>residuals</code> function on any linear model object.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-10">3.10</a> shows that there is a right skew present in the
residuals for the model for the prisoner ratings that accounted for different
means in the three picture groups, which is consistent with the initial assessment of
some right skew in the plots of observations in each group.</p>
<p>A Quantile-Quantile plot (<strong><em>QQ-plot</em></strong>)

shows the “match” of an observed
distribution with a theoretical distribution, almost always the normal
distribution. They are also known as Quantile Comparison, Normal Probability,
or Normal Q-Q plots, with the last two names being specific to comparing
results to a normal distribution. In this version<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a>, the QQ-plots display the value of
observed percentiles in the residual distribution on the y-axis versus the
percentiles of a theoretical normal distribution on the x-axis. If the
observed <strong>distribution of the residuals matches the shape of the normal
distribution, then the plotted points should follow a 1-1 relationship.</strong>
If the points follow the displayed straight line then that suggests that the
residuals have a similar shape to a normal distribution. Some variation is
expected around the line and some patterns of deviation are worse
than others for our models, so you need to go beyond saying “it does not match
a normal distribution”. It is best to be specific about the type of deviation
you are detecting. And to do that, we need to practice interpreting some
QQ-plots.</p>
<p>The QQ-plot of the linear model residuals from Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-9">3.9</a> is extracted and enhanced it a little to make Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-11">3.11</a> so we
can just focus on it.

We know from looking at the histogram that this is a
slightly right skewed distribution. The QQ-plot places the observed <strong><em>standardized</em></strong><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> <strong><em>residuals</em></strong> on the y-axis
and the theoretical normal values on the x-axis. The most noticeable deviation
from the 1-1 line is in the lower left corner of the plot. These are for the
negative residuals (left tail) and there are many residuals at around the same
value that are a little smaller than -1. If the distribution had followed the
normal distribution here, the points would be on the 1-1 line and there would
be some standardized residuals much smaller than -1.5. So we are not getting as
much spread in the smaller residuals as we would expect in a normal distribution.
If you go back to the histogram you can see that the smallest residuals are all
stacked up and do not spread out like the left tail of a normal distribution
should. In the right tail (positive) residuals, there is also a systematic
lifting from the 1-1 line to larger values in the residuals than the normal
would generate. For example, the point labeled as “82” in Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-9">3.9</a> (the 82<sup>nd</sup>
observation in the data set) has a value of 3 in residuals but should actually
be smaller (maybe 2.5) if the distribution was normal. Put together, this pattern
in the QQ-plot suggests that the left tail is too compacted (too short) and
the right tail is too spread out – this is the right skew we identified from the
histogram and density curve!

</div>
<p>Generally, when both tails deviate on the same side of the line (forming a
sort of quadratic curve, especially in more extreme cases), that is evidence
of a skew. To see some different potential shapes in QQ-plots, six different
data sets are displayed in Figures <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-12">3.12</a> and <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-13">3.13</a>.
In each row, a QQ-plot and associated density curve are displayed. If the points
are both above the 1-1 line in the lower and upper tails as in
Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-12">3.12</a>(a), then the pattern is a right skew, here even more
extreme than in the previous real data set. If the points are below the 1-1 line in both
tails as in Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-12">3.12</a>(c), then the pattern is identified as a
left skew. Skewed residual distributions (either direction) are problematic for
models that assume normally distributed responses but not necessarily for our
permutation approaches if all the groups have similar skewed shapes. The other
problematic pattern is to have more spread than a normal curve as in
Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-12">3.12</a>(e) and (f). This shows up with the points being
below the line in the left tail (more extreme negative than expected by the normal)
and the points being above the line for the right tail (more extreme positive
than the normal predicts). We call these distributions <strong><em>heavy-tailed</em></strong>
which can manifest as distributions with outliers in both tails or just a bit
more spread out than a normal distribution. Heavy-tailed residual distributions
can be problematic for our models as the variation is greater than what the normal
distribution can account for and our methods might under-estimate the
variability in the results. The opposite pattern with the left tail above the
line and the right tail below the line suggests less spread (<strong><em>lighter-tailed</em></strong>)
than a normal as in Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-12">3.12</a>(g) and (h). This pattern is
relatively harmless and you can proceed with methods that assume normality safely
as they will just be a little conservative. For any of the patterns, you would
note a potential violation of the normality assumption and then proceed to
describe the type of violation and how clear or extreme it seems to be.</p>

<p>Finally, to help you calibrate expectations for data that are actually normally
distributed, two data sets simulated from normal distributions are displayed in
Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-13">3.13</a>. Note how neither follows the line exactly but
that the overall pattern matches fairly well. <strong>You have to allow for some
variation from the line in real data sets</strong> and focus on when there are really
noticeable issues in the distribution of the residuals such as those
displayed above. Again, you will never be able to prove that you have normally
distributed residuals even if the residuals are all exactly on the line, but if
you see QQ-plots as in Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-12">3.12</a> you can determine that there is clear evidence of violations of the normality assumption.

<p>The last issues with assessing the assumptions in an ANOVA relates to
situations where the methods are more or less <strong><em>resistant</em></strong><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> to violations of assumptions.

In simulation studies of the performance of the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test, researchers
have found that the
parametric ANOVA <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test is more resistant to violations of the assumptions of
the normality and equal variance assumptions if the design is balanced.

A <strong><em>balanced design</em></strong> occurs when each group is measured the same number of
times. The resistance decreases as the data set becomes less balanced, as the
sample sizes in the groups are more different, so having close to balance is
preferred to a more imbalanced situation if there is a choice available. There
is some intuition available here – it makes some sense that you would have better
results in comparing groups if the information available is similar in all the
groups and none are relatively under-represented. We can check the number of
observations in each group to see if they are equal or similar using the
<code>tally</code> function from the <code>mosaic</code> package. This function is useful for
being able to get counts of observations, especially for cross-classifying
observations on two variables that is used in Chapter <a href="chapter5.html#chapter5">5</a>. For just
a single variable, we use <code>tally(~x, data=...)</code>:
</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">require</span>(mosaic)
<span class="kw">tally</span>(<span class="op">~</span>Attr, <span class="dt">data=</span>MockJury)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Attr
##    Beautiful      Average Unattractive 
##           39           38           37</code></pre>
<p>So the sample sizes do vary among the groups and the design is technically not
balanced, but it is also very close to being balanced with only two more
observations in the largest group compared to the smallest group size. This
tells us that the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test should have some resistance to violations of
assumptions. This nearly balanced design, and the moderate sample size
(over 37 per group is considered a good but not large sample), make the
parametric and nonparametric approaches provide similar results in this data
set even in the presence of the skewed residual error distribution that presents a violation to the assumptions of the parametric procedure.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Guinea pig tooth growth One-Way ANOVA example</h2>
<p>A second example of the One-way ANOVA methods involves a study of length of
odontoblasts (cells that are responsible for tooth growth) in 60 Guinea Pigs
(measured in microns) from <span class="citation">Crampton (<a href="#ref-Crampton1947" role="doc-biblioref">1947</a>)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(N=60\)</span> Guinea Pigs were obtained
from a local breeder and each received one of three dosages (0.5, 1, or
2 mg/day) of Vitamin C via one of two delivery methods, Orange Juice (<em>OJ</em>) or
ascorbic acid (the stuff in vitamin C capsules, called <span class="math inline">\(\text{VC}\)</span> below) as the source
of Vitamin C in their diets. Each guinea pig was randomly assigned to receive
one of the six different treatment combinations possible
(OJ at 0.5 mg, OJ at 1 mg, OJ at 2 mg, VC at 0.5 mg, VC at 1 mg, and VC at 2 mg).
The animals were treated similarly otherwise and we can assume lived in
separate cages and only one observation was taken for each guinea pig, so we
can assume the observations are independent<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a>. We need to create a variable that
combines the levels of delivery type (OJ, VC) and the dosages (0.5, 1, and 2)
to use our One-Way ANOVA on the six levels. The <code>interaction</code> function can be
used create a new variable that is based on combinations of the levels of other
variables. Here a new variable is created in the <code>ToothGrowth</code> tibble that
we called <code>Treat</code> using the <code>interaction</code> function that provides a six-level grouping variable for our One-Way
ANOVA to compare the combinations of treatments. To get a sense of the pattern of
observations in the data set, the counts in <code>supp</code> (supplement type) and
<code>dose</code> are provided and then the counts in the new categorical explanatory variable, <code>Treat</code>.</p>

Figure 3.14: (ref:fig3-14)
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-14">3.14</a> suggests that the mean tooth growth increases with
the dosage level and that OJ might lead to higher growth rates than VC except
at a dosage of 2 mg/day. The variability around the means looks to be small
relative to the differences among the means, so we should expect a small
p-value from our <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test. The design is balanced as noted above (<span class="math inline">\(n_j=10\)</span>
for all six groups) so the methods are some what resistant to impacts from
non-normality and non-constant variance but we should still
assess the patterns in the plots.

There is some suggestion of non-constant variance in the plots but this will be explored
further below when we can remove the difference in the means and combine all
the residuals together.

There might be some skew in the responses in some of
the groups but there are only 10 observations per group so
visual evidence of skew in the boxplots and beanplots
could be generated by impacts of very few of the observations.</p>
<p>Now we can apply our 6+ steps for performing a hypothesis test

with these observations. The initial step is deciding on the claim to be assessed and the
test statistic to use. This is a six group situation with a quantitative
response, identifying it as a One-Way ANOVA where we want to test a null
hypothesis that all the groups have the same population mean, at least to
start. We will use a 5% significance level.</p>

<li><p><strong>Find the p-value</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are two options here, especially since it seems that our assumptions about
variance and normality are not violated (note that we do not say “met” – we just have
no clear evidence against them). The parametric and nonparametric approaches should
provide similar results here.</p></li>
<li><p>The parametric approach is easiest – the p-value comes from the previous
ANOVA table as <code>&lt; 2e-16</code>. First, note that this is in scientific notation
that is a compact way of saying that the p-value here is <span class="math inline">\(2.2*10^{-16}\)</span> or
0.00000000000000022.
When you see <code>2.2e-16</code> in R output, it also means
that the calculation is at the numerical precision limits of the computer.
What R is really trying to report is that this is a very small number.
<strong>When you encounter p-values that are smaller than 0.0001, you should just
report that the p-value &lt; 0.0001.</strong> Do not report that it is 0 as this gives
the false impression that there is no chance of the result occurring when
it is just a really small probability. This p-value came from an <span class="math inline">\(F(5,54)\)</span>
distribution (this is the distribution of the test statistic if the null hypothesis
is true).</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> since the p-value is very small.</li>
</ul>
<p></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Write a conclusion and do scope of inference</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is strong evidence that the different treatments
(combinations of OJ/VC and dosage levels) <strong>cause some</strong> difference in the <strong>true</strong>
mean odontoblast growth for <strong>these</strong> guinea pigs.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We can make the causal statement of the treatment causing differences
because the treatments were randomly assigned but these inferences only
apply to these guinea pigs since they were not randomly selected from a
larger population.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that we are making inferences to the population or true
means and not the sample means and want to make that clear in any
conclusion. When there is not a random sample from a population it is
more natural to discuss the true means since we can’t extend to the
population values.</p></li>
<li><p>The alternative is that there is some difference in the true means
– be sure to make the wording clear that you aren’t saying that all
the means differ. In fact, if you look back at Figure
<a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-14">3.14</a>, the means for the 2 mg dosages look almost the
same so we will have a tough time arguing that all groups differ. The
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test is about finding evidence of some difference <em>somewhere</em> among the true means. The next section will
provide some additional tools to get more specific about the source of
those detected differences and allow us to get at estimates of the differences we observed to complete our interpretation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Before we leave this example, we should revisit our model estimates and
interpretations. The default model parameterization uses reference-coding.
Running the model <code>summary</code> function on <code>m2</code> provides the estimated
coefficients:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">summary</span>(m2)<span class="op">$</span>coefficients</code></pre>

<p>For some practice with the reference coding used in these models, let’s find
the estimates for observations for a couple of the groups. To work with the
parameters, you need to start with determining the baseline category that was
used by considering which level is not displayed in the output. The
<code>levels</code> function can list the groups in a categorical variable and their
coding in the data set. The first level is usually the baseline category but
you should check this in the model summary as well.</p>

<p>There is a <code>VC.0.5</code> in the second row of the model summary, but there is no row for
<code>0J.0.5</code> and so this must be the baseline category. That means that the fitted value
or model estimate for the OJ at 0.5 mg/day group is the same as the <code>(Intercept)</code> row
or <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\alpha}\)</span>, estimating a mean tooth growth of 13.23 microns when the pigs get OJ
at a 0.5 mg/day dosage level. You should always start with working on the baseline level
in a reference-coded model. To get estimates for any other group, then you can use the
<code>(Intercept)</code> estimate and add the deviation for the group of interest. For
<code>VC.0.5</code>, the estimated mean tooth growth is
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\tau}_2 = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\tau}_{\text{VC}0.5}=13.23 + (-5.25)=7.98\)</span>
microns. It is also potentially interesting to directly interpret the estimated difference
(or deviation) between <code>OJ.0.5</code> (the baseline) and <code>VC.0.5</code> (group 2) that
is <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\tau}_{\text{VC}0.5}= -5.25\)</span>: we estimate that the mean tooth growth in
<code>VC.0.5</code> is 5.25 microns shorter than it is in <code>OJ.0.5</code>. This and many other
direct comparisons of groups are likely of interest to researchers involved in
studying the impacts of these supplements on tooth growth and the next section
will show us how to do that (correctly!).</p>
<p>The reference-coding is still going to feel a little uncomfortable so the comparison
to the cell-means model and exploring the effect plot can help to reinforce
that both models patch together the same estimated means for each group. For
example, we can find our estimate of 7.98 microns for the VC0.5 group in the
output and Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-17">3.17</a>. Also note that Figure
<a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-17">3.17</a> is the same whether you plot the results from

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Multiple (pair-wise) comparisons using Tukey’s HSD and the compact letter display</h2>

<p>With evidence that the true means are likely not all equal, many researchers
want to know which groups show evidence of differing from one another. This
provides information on the source of the overall difference that was
detected and detailed information on which groups differed from one another.
Because this is a shot-gun/unfocused sort of approach, some people think it
is an over-used procedure. Others feel that
it is an important method of addressing detailed questions about group
comparisons in a valid and safe way. For example, we might want to know if OJ is
different from VC <em>at the 0.5 mg/day</em> dosage level and these methods will allow
us to get an answer to this sort of question.
It also will test for differences between the OJ.0.5 and VC.2 groups
and every other pair of levels that you can construct. This method actually
takes us back to the methods in Chapter <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a> where we compared the means of two
groups except that we need to deal with potentially many pair-wise comparisons,
making an adjustment to account for that inflation in Type I errors

that occurs due to many tests being performed at the same time.
There are many different statistical
methods to make all the pair-wise comparisons, but we will employ the most
commonly used one, called <strong><em>Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference</em></strong> (Tukey’s HSD) 
method<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a>. The name suggests that not using it could lead to a
dishonest answer and that it will give you an honest result. It is more that if you don’t
do some sort of correction for all the tests you are performing, you might find some <strong><em>spurious</em></strong><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> results. There are other methods that could be used
to do a similar correction and also provide “honest” inferences; we are just going to learn
one of them.</p>
<p>Generally, the challenge in this situation is that if you perform many tests at the same time (instead of just one test), you inflate the
Type I error rate.

We can define the <strong><em>family-wise error rate</em></strong> 
as the probability that at least one error is made on a set of tests or, more
compactly, Pr(At least 1 error is made) where Pr() is the probability of an
event occurring. The family-wise error is meant to capture the overall
situation in terms of measuring the likelihood of making a mistake if we
consider many tests, each with some chance of making their own mistake, and
focus on how often we make at least one error when we do many tests. A quick
probability calculation shows the magnitude of the problem. If we start with a
5% significance level test, then Pr(Type I error on one test) =0.05 and the Pr(no
errors made on one test) =0.95, by definition. This is our standard hypothesis
testing situation. Now, suppose we have <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> independent tests, then</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{ll}
&amp; \text{Pr(make at least 1 Type I error given all null hypotheses are true)} \\
&amp; = 1 - \text{Pr(no errors made)} \\
&amp; = 1 - 0.95^m.
\end{array}\]</span></p>
<p>Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-18">3.18</a> shows how the probability of having at least one
false detection grows rapidly with the number of tests, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. The plot stops at 100
tests since it is effectively a 100% chance of at least one false detection.
It might seem like doing 100 tests is a lot, but in Genetics research it is
possible to consider situations where millions of tests are
considered so these are real issues to be concerned about in many situations.
Researchers want to make sure that when they report a “significant” result that
it is really likely to be a real result and will show up as a difference in the
next data set they collect<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a>.</p>

Figure 3.18: (ref:fig3-18)
</p>
</div>
<p>In pair-wise comparisons between all the pairs of means in a One-Way ANOVA, the number of
tests is based on the number of pairs. We can calculate the number of tests using
<span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> choose 2, <span class="math inline">\(\begin{pmatrix}J\\2\end{pmatrix}\)</span>, to get the number of unique pairs of
size 2 that we can make out of <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> individual treatment levels. We don’t need to
explore the combinatorics formula for this, as the <code>choose</code> function in R can give us the
answers:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">choose</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>,<span class="dv">2</span>)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3</code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">choose</span>(<span class="dv">4</span>,<span class="dv">2</span>)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 6</code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">choose</span>(<span class="dv">5</span>,<span class="dv">2</span>)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 10</code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">choose</span>(<span class="dv">6</span>,<span class="dv">2</span>)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 15</code></pre>
<p>So if you have three groups (prisoner rating study), there are 3 unique pairs to
compare. For six groups, like in the guinea pig study, we have to consider 15 tests to compare all the unique pairs of groups. 15 tests seems like enough that we
should be worried about inflated family-wise error rates. Fortunately, the
Tukey’s HSD method controls the family-wise error rate at your specified level
(say 0.05) across any number of pair-wise comparisons. This means that the
overall rate of at least one Type I error is controlled at the specified
significance level, often 5%. To do this, each test must use a slightly more
conservative cut-off than if just one test is performed and the procedure helps
us figure out how much more conservative we need to be.</p>
<p>Tukey’s HSD starts  with focusing on the difference between the groups with the
largest and smallest means (<span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}_{max}-\bar{y}_{min}\)</span>). If
<span class="math inline">\((\bar{y}_{max}-\bar{y}_{min}) \le \text{Margin of Error}\)</span>
for the difference in the means, then all other pairwise differences, say
<span class="math inline">\(\vert \bar{y}_j - \bar{y}_{j&#39;}\vert\)</span>, for two groups <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j&#39;\)</span>, will be less
than or equal to that margin of error. This also means that any confidence
intervals for any difference in the means will contain 0. Tukey’s HSD selects a
critical value so that (<span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}_{max}-\bar{y}_{min}\)</span>) will be less than the margin of
error in 95% of data sets drawn from populations with a common mean. This implies
that in 95% of data sets in which all the population means are the same, all
confidence intervals for differences in pairs of means will contain 0. Tukey’s
HSD provides confidence intervals for the difference in true means between
groups <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j&#39;\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_j-\mu_{j&#39;}\)</span>, for all pairs where <span class="math inline">\(j \ne j&#39;\)</span>, using</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(\bar{y}_j - \bar{y}_{j&#39;}) \mp \frac{q^*}{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{\text{MS}_E\left(\frac{1}{n_j}+
\frac{1}{n_{j&#39;}}\right)}\]</span></p>
<p>where
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{q^*}{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{\text{MS}_E\left(\frac{1}{n_j}+\frac{1}{n_{j&#39;}}\right)}\)</span>
is the margin of error for the intervals. The distribution used
to find the multiplier, <span class="math inline">\(q^*\)</span>, for the confidence intervals is available in the
<code>qtukey</code> function and generally provides a slightly larger multiplier than the
regular <span class="math inline">\(t^*\)</span> from our two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-based confidence interval discussed in
Chapter <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a>. The formula otherwise is very similar to the one used in Chapter <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a> with the SE for the difference in the means based on a measure of residual variance (here <span class="math inline">\(MS_E\)</span>) times <span class="math inline">\(\left(\frac{1}{n_j}+\frac{1}{n_{j&#39;}}\right)\)</span> which weights the results based on the relative sample sizes in the groups.</p>
<p>We will use the <code>confint</code>, <code>cld</code>, and <code>plot</code> functions
applied to output from the <code>glht</code> function (all from the <code>multcomp</code> package;
<span class="citation">Hothorn, Bretz, and Westfall (<a href="#ref-Hothorn2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">(Hothorn, Bretz, and Westfall <a href="#ref-R-multcomp" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>) to easily get the required comparisons from our
ANOVA model.

Unfortunately, its code format is a little complicated – but there are
just two places to modify the code, by including the model name and after <code>mcp</code>
(stands for <em>multiple comparisons</em>) in the <code>linfct</code> option, you need to include the
explanatory variable name as <code>VARIABLENAME="Tukey"</code>. The last part is to get the
Tukey HSD multiple comparisons run on our explanatory variable. Once we obtain the
intervals, we can use them to test <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \mu_j = \mu_{j&#39;} \text{ vs } H_A: \mu_j \ne \mu_{j&#39;}\)</span>
by assessing whether 0 is in the confidence interval for each pair. If 0 is in the
interval, then there is no evidence of a difference for that pair. If 0 is not in the
interval, then we reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> and have evidence <em>at the specified family-wise significance
level</em> of a difference for that pair. You will see a switch to using the
word “detection” to describe rejected null hypotheses of no difference as it
can help to compactly write up these results. The following code provides the numerical

Figure 3.19: (ref:fig3-19)
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-19">3.19</a> contains confidence intervals for the difference in
the means for all 15 pairs of groups. For example, the first row in the plot contains
the confidence interval for comparing VC.0.5 and OJ.0.5 (VC.0.5 <strong>minus</strong> OJ.0.5). In the numerical output, you can find that this 95%
family-wise confidence interval goes from -10.05 to -0.45 microns (<code>lwr</code> and
<code>upr</code> in the numerical output provide the CI endpoints). This interval does not
contain 0 since its upper end point is -0.45 microns and so we can now say that
there is evidence that OJ and VC have different true mean growth rates at the 0.5 mg
dosage level. We can go further and say that we are 95% confident that the difference
in the true mean tooth growth between VC.0.5 and OJ.0.5 (VC.0.5-OJ.0.5) is between
-10.05 and -0.45 microns, after adjusting for comparing all the pairs of groups.
But there are fourteen more similar intervals…</p>
<p>If you put all these pair-wise tests together, you can generate an overall
interpretation of Tukey’s HSD results that discusses sets of groups that
are not detectably different from one another and those groups that were
distinguished from other sets of groups. To do this, start with listing
out the groups that are not detectably different (CIs contain 0), which,
here, only occurs for four of the pairs. The CIs that contain 0 are for the
pairs VC.1 and OJ.0.5, OJ.2 and OJ.1, VC.2 and OJ.1, and, finally, VC.2 and
OJ.2. So VC.2, OJ.1, and OJ.2 are all not detectably different from each
other and VC.1 and OJ.0.5 are also not detectably different. If you look carefully, VC.0.5 is detected as different from every other group. So there are basically
three sets of groups that can be grouped together as “similar”: VC.2, OJ.1,
and OJ.2; VC.1 and OJ.0.5; and VC.0.5. Sometimes groups overlap with some
levels not being detectably different from other levels that belong to
different groups and the story is not as clear as it is in this case. An
example of this sort of overlap is seen in the next section.</p>
<p>There is a method that many researchers use to more efficiently generate and
report these sorts of results that is called a <strong><em>compact letter display</em></strong> 
(CLD, <span class="citation">Piepho (<a href="#ref-Piepho2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>)<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a>. The <code>cld</code> function can be applied to the results from
<code>glht</code> to generate the CLD that we can use to provide a “simple” summary of
the sets of groups. In this discussion, we define a <strong>set as a union of different
groups that can contain one or more members</strong> and the member of these groups are
the different treatment levels.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">cld</span>(Tm2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## OJ.0.5 VC.0.5   OJ.1   VC.1   OJ.2   VC.2 
##    &quot;b&quot;    &quot;a&quot;    &quot;c&quot;    &quot;b&quot;    &quot;c&quot;    &quot;c&quot;</code></pre>

<p>Groups with the same letter are not detectably different (are in the same set)
and groups that are detectably different get different letters (are in
different sets). Groups can have more than one letter to reflect “overlap”
between the sets of groups and sometimes a set of groups contains only a
single treatment level (VC.0.5 is a set of size 1). Note
that if the groups have the same letter, this does not mean they are the same,
just that there is <strong>insufficient evidence to declare a difference for that pair</strong>. If we consider
the previous output for the CLD, the “a” set contains VC.0.5, the “b” set contains
OJ.0.5 and VC.1, and the “c” set contains OJ.1, OJ.2, and VC.2. These are exactly
the groups of treatment levels that we obtained by going through all fifteen
pairwise results.</p>
<p>One benefit of this work is that the CLD letters can be added to a plot (such as the beanplot) to
help fully report the results and understand the sorts of differences Tukey’s
HSD detected. The lines with <code>text</code> in them are involved in placing text on the figure but are
something you could do in image editing software just as easily.
Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-20">3.20</a> enhances the discussion by showing that the
“<b><font color='blue'>a</font></b>” group with VC.0.5 had the lowest average tooth
growth, the “<b><font color='red'>b</font></b>” group had intermediate tooth growth
for treatments OJ.0.5 and VC.1, and the highest growth rates came from
OJ.1, OJ.2, and VC.2. Even though VC.2 had the highest average growth rate,
we are not able to prove that its true mean is any higher
than the other groups labeled with “<b><font color='green'>c</font></b>”. Hopefully the
ease of getting to the story of the Tukey’s HSD results from a plot like this
explains why it is common to report results using these methods instead of
reporting 15 confidence intervals for all the pair-wise differences.</p>

<p>There are just a couple of other details to mention on this set of methods. First,
note that we interpret the set of confidence intervals simultaneously: We are
95% confident that <strong>ALL</strong> the intervals contain the respective differences in
the true means (this is a <strong><em>family-wise interpretation</em></strong>). These intervals are
adjusted from our regular 2 sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> intervals from Chapter <a href="chapter2.html#chapter2">2</a>
to allow this stronger interpretation. Specifically,
they are wider. Second, if sample sizes are unequal in the groups, Tukey’s HSD
is conservative and provides a family-wise error rate that is lower than the
<em>nominal</em> (or specified) level. In other words, it fails less often than expected
and the intervals provided are a little wider than needed, containing all the
pairwise differences at higher than the nominal confidence level of (typically)
95%. Third, this is a parametric approach and violations of normality and
constant variance will push the method in the other direction, potentially
making the technique dangerously liberal. Nonparametric approaches to this
problem are also possible, but will not be considered here.</p>

<div id="section3-7" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> Pair-wise comparisons for Prisoner Rating data</h2>
<p>In our previous work with the prisoner rating data, the overall ANOVA test
provided only marginal evidence of some difference in the true means across the
three groups with a p-value=0.067. Tukey’s HSD does not require you
to find a small p-value from your overall <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test to employ the methods
but if you apply it to situations with p-values larger than your
<em>a priori</em> significance level,
you are unlikely to find any pairs that are detected as being different. Some
statisticians suggest that you shouldn’t employ follow-up tests such as Tukey’s
HSD when there is not sufficient evidence to reject the overall null hypothesis
and would be able to reasonably criticize the following results. But for the

<p>At the family-wise 5% significance level, there are no pairs that are detectably different
– they all get the same letter of “a”.   Now we will produce results for the reader that
thought a 10% significance was suitable for this application before seeing any
of the results. We just need to change the confidence level or significance
level that the CIs or tests are produced with inside the functions. For the <code>confint</code>
function, the <code>level</code> option is the confidence level and for the <code>cld</code>, it is the
family-wise significance level. Note that 90% confidence corresponds to a 10%
significance level.</p>

</div>
<p>With family-wise 10% significance and 90% confidence levels, the
<em>Unattractive</em> and <em>Average</em> picture groups are detected as being different but
the <em>Average</em> group is not detected as different from <em>Beautiful</em> and
<em>Beautiful</em> is not detected to be different from <em>Unattractive</em>. This leaves the
“overlap” of groups across the sets of groups that was noted earlier. The
<em>Beautiful</em> level is not detected as being dissimilar from levels in two
different sets and so gets two different letters.</p>
<p>The beanplot (Figure <a href="chapter3.html#fig:Figure3-23">3.23</a>) helps to clarify some of the reasons
for this set of results. The detection of a difference between <em>Average</em> and
<em>Unattractive</em> just barely occurs and the mean for <em>Beautiful</em> is between the
other two so it ends up not being detectably different from either one. This
sort of overlap is actually a fairly common occurrence in these sorts of
situations so be prepared a mixed set of letters for some levels.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.8</span> Chapter summary</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we explored methods for comparing a quantitative response across
<span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> groups (<span class="math inline">\(J \ge 2\)</span>), with what is called the One-Way ANOVA procedure. The initial
test is based on assessing evidence against a null hypothesis of no difference in the true means for the <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> groups. There are two different methods for estimating these One-Way ANOVA models:
the cell-means model and the reference-coded versions of the model.
There are times when either model will be preferred, but for the rest of the text,
the reference coding is used (sorry!). The ANOVA <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-statistic,
often presented with
underlying information in the ANOVA table,

provides a method of assessing evidence
against the null hypothesis either using permutations or via the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-distribution.
Pair-wise comparisons using Tukey’s HSD provide a method for comparing all the groups
and are a nice complement to the overall ANOVA results. A compact letter display was
shown that enhanced the interpretation of Tukey’s HSD result.</p>
<p>In the guinea pig example, we are left with some lingering questions based on these
results. It appears that the effect of <em>dosage</em> changes as a function of the
<em>delivery method</em> (OJ, VC) because the size of the differences between OJ and VC
change for different dosages. These methods can’t directly assess the question
of whether the effect of delivery method is the same or not across the
different dosages. In Chapter <a href="chapter4.html#chapter4">4</a>, the two variables, <em>Dosage</em> and
<em>Delivery method</em> are modeled as two separate variables so we can consider their
effects both separately and together. This allows more refined hypotheses, such as
<em>Is the effect of delivery method the same for all dosages?</em>, to be tested. This
will introduce new models and methods for analyzing data where there are two
factors as explanatory variables in a model for a quantitative response variable
in what is called the Two-Way ANOVA.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.10</span> Practice problems</h2>
<p>For these practice problems, you will work with the cholesterol data set from
the <code>multcomp</code> package that was used to generate the Tukey’s HSD results. To
load the data set and learn more about the study, use the following code:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">require</span>(multcomp)
<span class="kw">data</span>(cholesterol)
<span class="kw">require</span>(tibble)
cholesterol &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">as.tibble</span>(cholesterol)
<span class="kw">help</span>(cholesterol)</code></pre>
<p>3.1. Graphically explore the differences in the changes in Cholesterol levels for
the five levels using boxplots and beanplots.</p>
<p>3.2. Is the design balanced? </p>
<p>3.3. Complete all 6+ steps of the hypothesis test using the parametric <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test,
reporting the ANOVA table and the distribution of the test statistic under the null.</p>
<p>3.4. Discuss the scope of inference using the information that the treatment levels
were randomly assigned to volunteers in the study.</p>
<p>3.5. Generate the permutation distribution and find the p-value. Compare the parametric
p-value to the permutation test results.</p>
<p>3.6. Perform Tukey’s HSD on the data set. Discuss the results – which pairs were
detected as different and which were not? Bigger reductions in cholesterol are
good, so are there any levels you would recommend or that might provide similar
reductions?</p>
<p>3.7. Find and interpret the CLD and compare that to your interpretation of results
from 3.6.</p>

<li id="fn38"><p>In Chapter <a href="chapter4.html#chapter4">4</a>, methods are discussed for when there are two
categorical explanatory variables that is called the Two-Way ANOVA and related
ANOVA tests are used in Chapter <a href="chapter8.html#chapter8">8</a> for working with extensions of
these models.<a href="chapter3.html#fnref38" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn39"><p>
If you look closely in the code for the rest of the book, any model for a
quantitative response will use this function, suggesting a common thread in
the most commonly used statistical models.<a href="chapter3.html#fnref39" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn40"><p>Suppose we were doing environmental monitoring
and were studying asbestos levels in soils. We might be hoping that the mean-only
model were reasonable to use if the groups being compared were in remediated areas
and in areas known to have never been contaminated.<a href="chapter3.html#fnref40" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn41"><p>Make sure you can work
from left to right and up and down to fill in the ANOVA table given just the
necessary information to determine the other components – there is always a
question like this on the exam…<a href="chapter3.html#fnref41" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn42"><p>This fits with a critique of p-value usage called
p-hacking or publication bias – where researchers search across many
results and only report their biggest differences. This biases the
results to detecting results more than they should be and then when
other researchers try to repeat the same studies, they fail to find
similar results.<a href="chapter3.html#fnref42" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn43"><p>We have been using this function quite a bit to make multi-panel
graphs but did not show you that line of code. But you need to use this command
for linear model diagnostics or you won’t get the plots we want from the model.
And you really just need <code>plot(lm2)</code> but the <code>pch=16</code> option makes it easier
to see some of the points in the plots.<a href="chapter3.html#fnref43" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn44"><p>Along with multiple names,
there is variation of what is plotted on the x and y axes and the scaling of
the values plotted, increasing the challenge of interpreting QQ-plots. We are
consistent about the x and y axis choices throughout this book but different functions that make
these plots in R do switch the axes.<a href="chapter3.html#fnref44" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn45"><p>Here this means re-scaled so that they should have similar
scaling to a standard normal with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. This does
not change the shape of the distribution but can make outlier identification
simpler – having a standardized residual more extreme than 5 or -5 would
suggest a deviation from normality since we rarely see values that many
standard deviations from the mean in a normal distribution. But mainly focus
on the shape of the pattern in the QQ-plot.<a href="chapter3.html#fnref45" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn46"><p>A resistant
procedure is one that is not severely impacted by a particular violation of an
assumption. For example, the median is resistant to the impact of
an outlier. But the mean is not a resistant measure as changing the value
of a single point changes the mean.<a href="chapter3.html#fnref46" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn47"><p>A violation of the independence
assumption could have easily been created if they measured cells in

two locations on each guinea pig or took measurements over time on each subject.<a href="chapter3.html#fnref47" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn48"><p>Note that to see all the group labels in the plot
when making the figure, you have to widen the plot window before copying the
figure out of R. You can resize the plot window using the small vertical and
horizontal “=” signs in the grey bars that separate the different panels in
RStudio.<a href="chapter3.html#fnref48" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn49"><p>In working with researchers on hundreds of projects, our
experience has been that we often require many conversations to discover
all the potential sources of issues in data sets, especially related to
assessing independence of the observations.<a href="chapter3.html#fnref49" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn50"><p>When this procedure is used with unequal group sizes it is also sometimes
called Tukey-Kramer’s method.<a href="chapter3.html#fnref50" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn51"><p>We often use “spurious” to describe falsely rejected null hypotheses, but
they are also called false detections.<a href="chapter3.html#fnref51" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn52"><p>Some researchers are now collecting multiple data
sets to use in a single study and using one data set to identify interesting
results and then using a validation or test data set that they withheld from
initial analysis to try to verify that the first results are also present in that
second data set. This also has problems but the only way to develop an understanding of a process is to look across a suite of studies and learn from that accumulation of evidence.<a href="chapter3.html#fnref52" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn53"><p>The plot of results usually contains all the labels of groups but if the labels are long or there many groups, sometimes the row labels are hard to see even with re-sizing the plot to make it taller in RStudio. The numerical output is
useful as a guide to help you read the plot.<a href="chapter3.html#fnref53" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn54"><p>Note that this method is implemented slightly differently than we explain here in some software packages so if you see this in a journal article, read the discussion carefully.<a href="chapter3.html#fnref54" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
