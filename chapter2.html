<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> (R)e-Introduction to statistics</h1>
<p>The previous material served to get us started in R and to get a quick review of same basic
descriptive statistics. Now we will begin to engage some new material and
exploit the power of R to do some statistical inference. Because inference is
one of the hardest topics to master in statistics, we will also review some
basic terminology that is required to move forward in learning more
sophisticated statistical methods. To keep this “review” as short as possible,
we will not consider every situation you learned in introductory statistics and
instead focus exclusively on the situation where we have a quantitative
response variable measured on two groups, adding a new graphic called a “bean
plot”  to help us see the differences in the observations in the groups.</p>
<p>##Histograms, boxplots, and density curves {#section2-1}</p>
<p>Part of learning statistics is learning to correctly use the terminology, some of which is used colloquially
differently than it is used in formal statistical settings. The most commonly
“misused” statistical term is <strong><em>data</em></strong>.   In statistical parlance, we want to note the plurality of
data. Specifically, <strong><em>datum</em></strong> is a single measurement, possibly on multiple random
variables, and so it is appropriate to say that “<strong>a datum is…</strong>”.
Once we move to discussing data, we are now referring to more than one
observation, again on one, or possibly more than one, random variable, and
so we need to use “<strong>data are…</strong>” when talking about our observations. We want
to distinguish our use of the term “data” from its more
colloquial<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> usage that often involves treating it as singular.
In a statistical setting
“data” refers to measurements of our cases or units. When we summarize the
results of a study (say providing the mean and SD), that information is not
“data”. We used our data to generate that information. Sometimes we also use
the term “data set” to refer to all our observations and this is a singular
term to refer to the group of observations and this makes it really easy to
make mistakes on the usage of “data”<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>
<p>It is also really important to note that <strong><em>variables</em></strong> have to vary –
if you measure the level of education of your subjects but all are high school graduates, then you do
not have a “variable”. You may not know if you have real variability in a
“variable” until you explore the results you obtained.</p>
<p>The last, but probably most important, aspect of data is the context
of the measurement. The “who, what, when, and where” of the collection
of the observations is critical to the
sort of conclusions we can make based on the results. The information on the
study design provides information required to assess the scope of inference of
the study.  Generally, remember to think about the research questions the
researchers were trying to answer and whether their study actually would answer
those questions. There are no formulas to help us sort some of these things
out, just critical thinking about the context of the measurements.</p>
<p>To make this concrete, consider the data collected from a study
<span class="citation">(Plaster <a href="#ref-Plaster1989" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> to investigate whether
perceived physical attractiveness had an impact on the sentences or perceived
seriousness of a crime that male jurors might give to female defendants. The
researchers showed the participants in the study (men who volunteered from a
prison) pictures of one of three young women. Each picture had previously been
decided to be either beautiful, average, or unattractive by the researchers.
Each “juror” was randomly assigned to one of three levels of this factor

(which is a categorical <em>predictor</em> or <em>explanatory</em> variable) 
and then each participant rated their
picture on a variety of traits such as how warm or sincere the woman appeared.
Finally, they were told the women had committed a crime (also randomly assigned
to either be told she committed a burglary or a swindle) and were asked to rate
the seriousness of the crime and provide a suggested length of sentence. We
will bypass some aspects of their research and just focus on differences in the
sentence suggested among the three pictures. To get a sense of these data,
let’s consider the first and last parts of the data set:</p>

<p>When working with data, we should always start with
summarizing the sample size. We will use <strong><em>n</em></strong>  for the
number of subjects in the sample and denote the population size (if
available) with <strong><em>N</em></strong>.  Here, the sample size is <strong><em>n=114</em></strong>. In
this situation, we do not have a random sample from a population 
(these were volunteers from the population of prisoners at the
particular prison) so we cannot make inferences from our sample to a larger group.
But we can assess whether there is a  <strong><em>causal effect</em></strong><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>: if sufficient evidence is found to conclude that there is some difference in
the responses across the treated groups, we can attribute those differences to
the treatments applied, since the groups should be same otherwise due to the
pictures being randomly assigned to the “jurors”. The story of the data set –
that it was collected on prisoners – becomes pretty important in thinking about
the ramifications of any results. Are male prisoners different from the
population of college males or all residents of a state such as Montana? If so,
then we should not assume that the detected differences, if detected, would
also exist in some other group of male subjects. The lack of a random sample 
makes it impossible to assume that this set of prisoners might be like other
prisoners. So there are definite limitations to the inferences in the following
results. But it is still interesting to see if the pictures caused a difference
in the suggested mean sentences, even though the inferences are limited to this
group of prisoners. If this had been an observational study (suppose that the
prisoners could select one of the three pictures), then we would have to avoid
any of the “causal” language that we can consider here because the pictures
were not randomly assigned to the subjects. Without random assignment,  the
explanatory variable of picture choice could be <strong><em>confounded</em></strong> 
with another characteristic of prisoners that was related to which picture they selected and
the rating they provided. Confounding is not the only reason to avoid causal
statements with non-random assignment but the inability to separate the effect
of other variables (measured or unmeasured) from the differences we are
observing means that our inferences in these situations need to be carefully
stated to avoid implying causal effects.</p>
<p>Instead of loading this data set into R using the “Import Dataset”
functionality, we can load an R

package that contains the data, making for easy access to this data set. The
package called <code>heplots</code> <span class="citation">(Fox and Friendly <a href="#ref-R-heplots" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> contains a data set called <code>MockJury</code>
that contains the results of the study.

We also rely on the R package called
<code>mosaic</code> <span class="citation">(Pruim, Kaplan, and Horton <a href="#ref-R-mosaic" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> that was introduced previously. First (but only once),
you need to install both packages, which can
be done either using the Packages tab in the lower right panel of RStudio or
using the <code>install.packages</code> function with quotes around the package name:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="op">&gt;</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">install.packages</span>(<span class="st">&quot;heplots&quot;</span>)</code></pre>
<p>After making sure that both packages are installed, we use the <code>require</code>
function around the package name (no quotes now!) to load the package, something that
you need to do any time you want to use features of a package.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">require</span>(heplots)
<span class="kw">require</span>(mosaic)</code></pre>
<p>When you are loading a package, R might mention a need to install other packages. If the output says that it needs a package that is
unavailable, then follow the same process noted above to install that package
and then repeat trying to load the package you wanted. These are called package “dependencies” and are due to one package developer relying on functions that already exist in another package.</p>
<p>To load the data set that is available in an active package, we use the
<code>data</code> function.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">data</span>(MockJury)</code></pre>
<p>Some data sets, like this one, will load in a different data set framework
called a “data frame” (its class in R is “data.frame”). You can leave it in this
format but for consistency of output, we will change it to a <em>tibble</em> using the
<code>as.tibble</code> function in the code that follows. Now there will be a tibble called
<code>MockJury</code> available for us to
analyze and some information about it in the <strong>Environment</strong> tab. Again, we
can find out more about the data set in a couple of ways. First,
we can use the <code>View</code> function to provide a spreadsheet type of display
in the upper left panel. Second, we can use the <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>
functions to print out the beginning and end of the data set.<br />

<p>If we take a few moments to explore the output we can discover some
useful aspects of the data set. The output is organized by variable,
providing summary information based on the type of
variable, either counts by category for categorical variables (<code>Attr</code>
and <code>Crime</code>) or the 5-number summary plus the mean for quantitative
variables. If present, you would also get a count of missing values that are
called “NAs” in R.  For the first variable, called <code>Attr</code> in the data.frame
and that we might more explicitly name <em>Attractiveness</em>, we find counts of the
number of subjects shown each picture: <span class="math inline">\(37\)</span> out of <span class="math inline">\(114\)</span> viewed the
“Unattractive” picture, <span class="math inline">\(38\)</span> viewed “Average”, and <span class="math inline">\(39\)</span> viewed “Beautiful”.
We can also see that suggested prison sentences (variable
<code>Years</code>) ranged from 1 year to 15 years with a median of 3 years.
It seems that all the other variables except for <em>Crime</em> (type of crime
that they were told the pictured woman committed) contained responses
between 1 and 9 based on rating scales from 1 = low to 9 = high.</p>
<p>To accompany the numerical summaries, histograms and boxplots can
provide some initial information on the shape of the distribution of
the responses for the suggested sentences in <em>Years</em>. Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-1">2.1</a>
contains the histogram
and boxplot of <em>Years</em>, ignoring any information on which picture the
“jurors” were shown. The calls to the two plotting functions are
enhanced slightly to add better labels.</p>

<p>The distribution appears to have a strong right skew with three
observations at 15 years flagged as potential
outliers. You can only tell that there are three observations and that they are
at 15 by looking at both plots – the bar around 15 years in the histogram has a
count of three and the boxplot only shows a single point at 15 which is
actually three tied points at exactly 15 years plotted on top of each other (we
call this “overplotting”). These three observations really seem to be the upper
edge of the overall pattern of a strongly right skewed distribution, so even
though they are flagged in the boxplot, they really are not outside the pattern we observed so are not outliers. In real data sets, outliers are commonly encountered and the
first step is to verify that they were not errors in recording (if so, fixing or removing them is easily justified). If they cannot be easily dismissed or fixed, the next step
is to study their impact on the statistical analyses performed, potentially
considering reporting results with and without the influential observation(s)
in the results. If the analysis is unaffected by the “unusual” observations,
then it matters little whether they are dropped or not. If they do affect the
results, then reporting both versions of results allows the reader to judge the
impacts for themselves. It is important to remember that sometimes the outliers
are the most interesting part of the data set. </p>
<p>Often when statisticians think of distributions of data, we think
of the smooth underlying
shape that led to the data set that is being displayed in the histogram.
Instead of binning up observations and making bars in the histogram, we can
estimate what is called a <strong><em>density curve</em></strong> as a smooth curve
that represents the observed distribution of the responses. Density curves can
sometimes help us see features of the data sets more clearly. </p>
<p>To understand the density curve, it is useful to initially see
the histogram and density curve together. The height of the density curve is scaled
so that the total area under the curve<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> is 1. To make a comparable histogram, the
y-axis needs to be scaled so that the histogram is also on the “density”
scale which makes the bar heights adjust so that the proportion of the
total data set in each bar is represented by the area in each bar
(remember that area is height times width). So the height depends on the
width of the bars and the total area across all the bars has to be 1. In the
<code>hist</code> function, the <code>freq=F</code> option does this required re-scaling to get
density-scaled histogram bars. The
density curve is added to the histogram using the R code of
<code>lines(density())</code>, producing the result in Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-2">2.2</a> with
added modifications of options for <code>lwd</code> (line width) and <code>col</code> (color)
to make the plot more interesting. You can see how the density curve
somewhat matches the histogram bars but deals with the bumps up and down
and edges a little differently. We can pick out the strong right skew using
either display and will rarely make both together.</p>

<p>Histograms can be sensitive to the choice of the number of bars and
even the cut-offs used to define the bins for a given number of bars.
Small changes in the definition of cut-offs for the bins can have
noticeable impacts on the shapes observed but
this does not impact density curves. We are not going to tinker with the
default choices for bars in histogram as they are reasonably selected, but we
can add information on the original observations being included in each bar to
better understand the choices that <code>hist</code> is making. In the previous
display, we can add what is called a <strong><em>rug</em></strong> to the plot, where a tick
mark is made on the x-axis for each observation.  Because the responses
were provided as whole years (1, 2, 3, …, 15), we need to use a graphical
technique called <strong><em>jittering</em></strong> to add a little noise<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> to each observation so all the
observations at each year value do not
plot as a single line.  In Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-3">2.3</a>, the added tick marks
on the x-axis show the approximate locations of the original observations.
We can see how there are 3 observations at 15 (all were 15 and the noise
added makes it possible to see them all). The limitations of the
histogram arise around the 10 year sentence
area where there are many responses at 10 years and just one at both 9 and 11 years,
but the histogram bars sort of miss this aspect of the data set. The
density curve did show a small bump at 10 years. Density curves are, however,
not perfect and this one shows area for sentences less than 0 years which is
not possible here.</p>

<p>The graphical tools we’ve just discussed are going to help us move to comparing the
distribution of responses across more than one group. We will have two displays
that will help us make these comparisons. The simplest is
the <strong><em>side-by-side boxplot</em></strong>, where a boxplot is displayed for each group
of interest using the same y-axis scaling.  In R, we can use its <strong><em>formula</em></strong>
notation to see if the response (<code>Years</code>) differs based on the group
(<code>Attr</code>) by using something like <code>Y~X</code> or, here, <code>Years~Attr</code>.
We also need to tell R where to find the variables – use the last option in the command, <code>data=DATASETNAME</code> , to inform R of the tibble to look in
to find the variables. In this example, <code>data=MockJury</code>. We will use
the formula and <code>data=...</code> options in almost every function we use
from here forward. Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-4">2.4</a> contains the side-by-side
boxplots showing right skew for all the groups, slightly higher median and
more variability for the <em>Unattractive</em> group along with some potential outliers indicated in two of the three groups.</p>

<p>The “~” (which is read as the <em>tilde</em> symbol, which you can find in the
upper left corner of your keyboard) notation will be used in two ways this
semester.  The formula use in R employed previously declares that the
response variable here is <em>Years</em> and the explanatory variable is <em>Attr</em>.
The other use for “~” is as shorthand for “is distributed as” and is used in
the context of <span class="math inline">\(Y\sim N(0,1)\)</span>, which translates (in statistics) to defining the
random variable <em>Y</em> as following a Normal distribution<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>

with mean 0
and standard deviation of 1. In the current situation, we could ask whether
the <code>Years</code> variable seems like it may follow a normal distribution, in
other words, is <span class="math inline">\(\text{Years}\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)\)</span>? Since the responses are right
skewed with some groups having outliers, it is not reasonable to assume that
the <em>Years</em> variable for any of the three groups may follow a normal
distribution (more later on the issues this creates!). Remember that
<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> are parameters where
<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> (“mu”) is our standard symbol for the <strong><em>population mean</em></strong>
and that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> (“sigma”) is the symbol of the
<strong><em>population standard deviation</em></strong>.  </p>
<p>##Beanplots {#section2-2}</p>
<p>The other graphical display for comparing multiple groups we will use is a display called a <strong><em>beanplot</em></strong> <span class="citation">(Kampstra <a href="#ref-Kampstra2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>.  Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-5">2.5</a>
shows an example of a beanplot  that provides a side-by-side display that
contains the density curves, the original observations that generated the
density curve in a (jittered) rug-plot, the mean of each group, and the
overall mean of the entire data set. For each group, the density curves
are mirrored to aid in visual assessment of the shape of the distribution,
which makes a “bean” of sorts. This mirroring also
creates a shape that resembles a violin with skewed distributions so this
display has also been called a “violin plot”. The beanplot  includes bold
horizontal lines at the mean for each group and adds a lighter
dashed line for the overall mean to allow comparison of that global mean with the individual group means. All together this plot shows us information
on the center (mean), spread, and shape of the distributions of the responses.
Our inferences typically focus on the means of the groups and this plot allows
us to compare those across the groups while gaining information on the shapes
of the distributions of responses in each group.</p>
<p>To use the <code>beanplot</code> function  we need to install and then load the <code>beanplot</code>
package <span class="citation">(Kampstra <a href="#ref-R-beanplot" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>.

The function works like the boxplot used previously
except that options
for <code>log</code>, <code>col</code>, and <code>method</code> need to be specified. Use these<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> options for any beanplots you make: 
<code>log="", col="bisque", method="jitter"</code>.</p>

to mean of each group, dashed line for overall or global mean.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-5">2.5</a> reinforces the strong right skews that were also
detected in the boxplots previously. The three large sentences of 15 years
can now be clearly identified, with one in the <em>Beautiful</em> group and two in
the <em>Unattractive</em> group. The <em>Unattractive</em> group seems to have more high
observations than the other groups even though the <em>Beautiful</em> group had the
largest number of observations around 10 years. The mean sentence was highest
for the <em>Unattractive</em> group and the difference in the means between
<em>Beautiful</em> and <em>Average</em> was small.</p>
<p>In this example, it appears that the mean for <em>Unattractive</em> is larger
than the other two groups. But is this difference real? We will never
know the answer to that question, but we
can assess how likely we are to have seen a result as extreme or more
extreme than our result, assuming that there is no difference in the
means of the groups. And if the observed result is
(extremely) unlikely to occur, then we can reject the hypothesis that the
groups have the same mean and conclude that there is evidence of a real
difference. To start exploring whether there are differences in the means, we
need to have numerical values to compare. We can get means and standard
deviations by groups easily using the same formula notation with the <code>mean</code>
and <code>sd</code> functions if the <code>mosaic</code> package is loaded.</p>

<p>We can also use the <code>favstats</code> function to get those summaries and others by groups.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">favstats</span>(Years<span class="op">~</span>Attr, <span class="dt">data=</span>MockJury)</code></pre>

## 3 Unattractive   1  2      5 10.0  15 5.810811 4.364235 37       0</code></pre>
<p>Based on these results, we can see that there is an estimated difference of
almost 2 years in the mean sentence between <em>Average</em> and <em>Unattractive</em> groups. Because there are three groups being compared in this study, we will have to
wait until Chapter 3 and the One-Way ANOVA test to fully assess evidence
related to some difference among the three groups. For now, we are going to
focus on comparing the mean <em>Years</em> between <em>Average</em> and <em>Unattractive</em> groups
– which is a <strong><em>two independent sample mean</em></strong> situation and something you
should have seen before. Remember that the “independent” sample part of
this refers to observations that are independently observed for the two
groups as opposed to the paired sample situation that you may have
explored where one observation from the first group is related to an
observation in the second group (two measures on the same person (we
generically call this “repeated measures”)
or the famous “twin” studies with one twin assigned to each group). </p>
<p>Here we are going to use the “simple” two independent group scenario to
review some basic statistical concepts and connect two different
frameworks for conducting statistical inference: randomization and
parametric  inference techniques. <strong><em>Parametric</em></strong> statistical methods
involve making assumptions

about the distribution of the
responses and obtaining confidence intervals and/or p-values using a
<em>named</em> distribution (like the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distributions). Typically these
results are generated using formulas and looking up areas under curves or
cutoffs using a table or a computer. <strong><em>Randomization</em></strong>-based statistical
methods use a computer to shuffle, sample, or simulate observations in ways
that allow you to obtain distributions of possible results to find areas and
cutoffs without resorting to using tables and named distributions.
Randomization methods are what are called <strong><em>nonparametric</em></strong> methods

that often make fewer assumptions (they are <strong><em>not free of assumptions</em></strong>!)
and so can handle a larger set of problems more easily than parametric
methods.

When the assumptions involved in the parametric procedures are
met by a data set, the randomization methods often provide very similar
results to those provided by the parametric techniques. To be a more
sophisticated statistical consumer, it is useful to have some knowledge
of both of these techniques for performing statistical inference and the fact that
they can provide similar results might deepen your understanding of both
approaches.</p>
<p>We will start with comparing the <em>Average</em> and <em>Unattractive</em> groups to
compare these two ways of doing inference. We could remove the <em>Beautiful</em>
group observations in a spreadsheet program and read that new data set
back into R, but it is actually pretty easy to use R to do data
management once the data set is loaded. To remove the observations that came
from the <em>Beautiful</em> group, we are going to generate a new variable
that we will call <code>NotBeautiful</code> that is true when observations came
from another group (<em>Average</em> or <em>Unattractive</em>) and false for observations
from the <em>Beautiful</em> group. To do this, we will apply the <strong><em>not equal</em></strong>
logical function (<code>!=</code> ) to the variable <code>Attr</code>, inquiring whether it
was different from the <code>"Beautiful"</code> level. You can see the content of the
new variable in the output:</p>

<p>To get rid of one of the responses that are in one of the groups, we need to learn a little bit about data
management in R. <strong><em>Brackets</em></strong> <code>([,])</code> are used to access and possibly modify the rows or
columns in a tibble with entries before the comma operating on rows and
entries after the comma on the columns. For example, if you want to see the
results for the 5<sup>th</sup> subject, you can reference the 5<sup>th</sup> row of the
tibble using <code>[5,]</code> after the tibble name:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">MockJury[<span class="dv">5</span>,]</code></pre>

<p>In R, we can use logical vectors to keep any rows of the tibble where
the variable is true and drop any rows where it is false by placing the
logical variable in the first element of the brackets. The reduced version
of the data set should be saved with a different name such as <code>MockJury2</code>
that is used here to reduce the chances of confusing it with the previous
full data set:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">MockJury2 &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>MockJury[MockJury<span class="op">$</span>NotBeautiful,]</code></pre>
<p>You will always want to check that the correct observations were dropped
either using <code>View(MockJury2)</code> or by doing a quick summary of the
<code>Attr</code> variable in the new tibble.</p>

<p>It ends up that R remembers the <em>Beautiful</em> category even though there are
0 observations in it now and that can cause us some problems. When we remove a
group of observations<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>, we sometimes need to clean up categorical variables to
just reflect the categories that are present. The <code>factor</code>

function
creates categorical variables based on the levels of the variables that are
observed and is useful to run here to clean up <code>Attr</code>.</p>

<p>The two-sample mean techniques you learned in your previous course all
start with comparing the means the two groups. We can obtain the two
means using the <code>mean</code> function or directly obtain the difference
in the means using the <code>diffmean</code> function (both require the <code>mosaic</code>
package). The <code>diffmean</code> function provides
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_\text{Unattractive} - \bar{x}_\text{Average}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>
(read as “x-bar”) is the sample mean of observations in the subscripted
group. Note that there are two directions that you could compare the
means and this function chooses to take the mean from the second group
name <em>alphabetically</em> and subtract the mean from the first alphabetical group
name. It is always good to check the direction of this calculation as
having a difference of <span class="math inline">\(-1.84\)</span> years versus <span class="math inline">\(1.84\)</span> years could be important.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Models, hypotheses, and permutations for the two sample mean situation</h2>

<p>There appears to be some evidence that the <em>Unattractive</em> group is
getting higher average lengths of sentences from the prisoner “jurors” than
the <em>Average</em> group, but we want to make sure that the difference is
real – that there is evidence to reject the assumption that the means
are the same “in the population”. First, a <strong><em>null hypothesis</em></strong><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> which
defines a <strong><em>null model</em></strong><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a>

needs to be determined in terms of <strong><em>parameters</em></strong> (the true values in
the population). The research question should help you determine the form of the
hypotheses for the assumed population. In the two independent sample mean
problem, the interest is in testing a null hypothesis of <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2\)</span>
versus the alternative hypothesis of <span class="math inline">\(H_A: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span> is the parameter for the true mean of the first group and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2\)</span>
is the parameter for the true mean of the second group. The alternative
hypothesis involves assuming a statistical model

for the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\ (i=1,\ldots,n_j)\)</span>
response from the <span class="math inline">\(j^{th}\ (j=1,2)\)</span> group, <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{y}_{ij}\)</span>, that
involves modeling it as <span class="math inline">\(y_{ij} = \mu_j + \varepsilon_{ij}\)</span>,
where we assume that <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{ij} \sim N(0,\sigma^2)\)</span>. For the moment,
focus on the models that either assume the means are the same (null) or
different (alternative),

which imply:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Null Model: <span class="math inline">\(y_{ij} = \mu + \varepsilon_{ij}\)</span> There is <strong>no</strong>
difference in <strong>true</strong> means for the two groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternative Model: <span class="math inline">\(y_{ij} = \mu_j + \varepsilon_{ij}\)</span> There is <strong>a</strong>
difference in <strong>true</strong> means for the two groups.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose we are considering the alternative model for the 4<sup>th</sup>
observation (<span class="math inline">\(i=4\)</span>) from the second group (<span class="math inline">\(j=2\)</span>), then the model for
this observation is <span class="math inline">\(y_{42} = \mu_2 +\varepsilon_{42}\)</span>, that defines the
response as coming from the true mean for the second group plus a
random error term for that observation, <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{42}\)</span>. For, say, the
5<sup>th</sup> observation from the first group (<span class="math inline">\(j=1\)</span>), the model is
<span class="math inline">\(y_{51} = \mu_1 +\varepsilon_{51}\)</span>. If we were working with the null model,
the mean is always the same (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>) – the group specified does not change
the mean we use for that observation.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to think about the null and alternative models graphically.

By assuming the null hypothesis is true (means are equal) and that the random
errors around the mean follow a normal distribution,

we assume that the truth
is as displayed in the left panel of Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-7">2.7</a> – two
normal distributions with the same mean and variability. The alternative
model allows the two groups to potentially have different means, such as
those displayed in the right panel of Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-7">2.7</a> where the
second group has a larger mean. Note that in this scenario, we assume that
the observations all came from the same distribution except that they had
different means. Depending on the statistical procedure we are using, we
basically are going to assume that the observations (<span class="math inline">\(y_{ij}\)</span>) either were
generated as samples from the null or alternative model. You can imagine
drawing observations at random from the pictured distributions. For hypothesis
testing, the null model

is assumed to be true and then the unusualness of
the actual result is assessed relative to that assumption. In hypothesis
testing, we have to decide if we have enough evidence to reject the assumption
that the null model (or hypothesis) is true. If we reject the null hypothesis,
then we would conclude that the other model considered (the alternative
model)

is more reasonable. The researchers obviously would have hoped to
encounter some sort of noticeable difference in the sentences provided for the
different pictures and have been able to find enough evidence to reject the null
model where the groups “look the same”.</p>
<p>(ref:fig2-7) Illustration of the assumed situations under the null (left)
and a single possibility that could occur if the alternative were true
(right) and the true means were different. There are an infinite number of ways to make a plot like the right panel that satisfies the alternative hypothesis.</p>

<p>In statistical inference, null hypotheses (and their
implied models) are set
up as “straw men” with every interest in rejecting them even though we assume
they are true to be able to assess the evidence <span class="math inline">\(\underline{\text{against them}}\)</span>.
Consider the original study design here, the pictures were randomly assigned to
the subjects. If the null hypothesis were true, then we would have no difference
in the population means of the groups. And this would apply if we had done a
different random assignment  of the pictures to the subjects. So let’s try this:
assume that the null hypothesis is true and randomly re-assign the treatments
(pictures) to the observations that were obtained. In other words, keep the
sentences (<em>Years</em>) the same and shuffle the group labels randomly. The
technical term for this is doing a <strong><em>permutation</em></strong>  (a random shuffling of
a grouping variable relative to the observed responses). If the null is true
and the means
in the two groups are the same, then we should be able to re-shuffle the
groups to the observed sentences (<em>Years</em>) and get results similar to those we
actually observed. If the null is false and the means are really different in
the two groups, then what we observed should differ from what we get under
other random permutations. The differences between the two groups should be
more noticeable in the observed data set than in (most) of the shuffled data
sets. It helps to see an example of a permutation of the labels to understand
what this means here.</p>
<p>In the <code>mosaic</code> package, the <code>shuffle</code> function allows us to easily perform
a  permutation<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a>. Just one time, we can explore what a permutation of the
treatment labels could look like in the <code>PermutedAttr</code> variable below. Note
that the <code>Years</code> are held in the same place while the group labels are shuffled.</p>

<p>If you count up the number of subjects in each group by counting the number
of times each label (Average, Unattractive) occurs, it is the same in both the
<code>Attr</code> and <code>PermutedAttr</code> columns. Permutations involve randomly
re-ordering the values of a variable – here the <code>Attr</code> group labels – without
changing the content of the variable.

This result can also be generated using
what is called <strong><em>sampling without replacement</em></strong>: sequentially select <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> labels
from the original variable (<em>Attr</em>), removing each observed label and making sure that each of the
original <code>Attr</code> labels is selected once and only once. The new, randomly
selected order of selected labels provides the permuted labels. Stepping
through the process helps to understand how it works: after the initial random
sample of one label, there would <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span> choices possible; on the <span class="math inline">\(n^{th}\)</span>
selection, there would only be one label remaining to select. This makes sure
that all original labels are re-used but that the order is random. Sampling
without replacement is like picking names out of a hat, one-at-a-time, and not
putting the names back in after they are selected. It is an exhaustive process
for all the original observations. <strong><em>Sampling with replacement</em></strong>, in contrast,
involves sampling from the specified list with each observation having an equal
chance of selection for each sampled observation – in other words, observations
can be selected more than once. This is like picking <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> names out of a hat that
contains <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> names, except that every time a name is selected, it goes back into
the hat – we’ll use this technique in Section <a href="chapter2.html#section2-8">2.6</a>
to do what is called <strong><em>bootstrapping</em></strong>.

Both sampling mechanisms can be
used to generate inferences but each has particular situations
where they are most useful. For hypothesis testing,

we will use permutations 
(sampling without replacement) as its mechanism most closely matches the null hypotheses we will be testing.</p>
<p>The comparison of the beanplots  for the real data set and permuted version of
the labels is what is really interesting (Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-8">2.8</a>). The
original difference in the sample means of the two groups was 1.84 years
(<em>Unattractive</em> minus <em>Average</em>). The sample means are the <strong><em>statistics</em></strong>
that estimate the parameters for the true means of the two groups. In the
permuted data set, the difference in the means is 1.15 years in the opposite
direction (Average had a higher mean than Unattractive in the permuted data).</p>

<p>These results suggest that the observed difference was larger than what we got
when we did a single permutation  although it was only a little bit larger than
a difference we could observe in permutations if we ignore the difference in
directions. Conceptually, permuting observations between group labels is
consistent with the null hypothesis – this is a technique to generate results
that we might have gotten if the null hypothesis were true since the responses
are the same in the two groups if the null is true. We just need to repeat the
permutation process many times and track how unusual our observed result is
relative to this distribution of potential responses if the null were true.
If the observed differences are unusual relative to the results under
permutations, then there is evidence against the null hypothesis, the null
hypothesis should be rejected (Reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>), and a conclusion should be made,
in the direction of the alternative hypothesis, that there is evidence that the
true means differ. If the observed differences are similar to (or at least not
unusual relative to) what we get under random shuffling under the null model,
we would have a tough time concluding that there is any real difference between
the groups based on our observed data set.</p>

<div id="section2-4" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Permutation testing for the two sample mean situation</h2>
<p>In any testing situation, you must define some function of the observations that
gives us a single number that addresses our question of interest. This quantity
is called a <strong><em>test statistic</em></strong>. These often take on complicated forms and
have names like <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> statistics that relate to their parametric

(named)
distributions so we know where to look up
<strong><em>p-values</em></strong><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>. In randomization settings, they can
have simpler forms because we use the data set to find the
distribution of the statistic and don’t need to rely on a
named distribution. We will label our test statistic <strong><em>T</em></strong>
(for <strong>T</strong>est statistic) unless the test statistic has a commonly
used name. Since we are interested in comparing the means of the two groups, we
can define</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T=\bar{x}_\text{Unattractive}-\bar{x}_\text{Average},\]</span></p>
<p>which coincidentally is what the <code>diffmean</code> function provided us previously.
We label our <strong><em>observed test statistic</em></strong> (the one from the original data
set) as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T_{obs}=\bar{x}_\text{Unattractive}-\bar{x}_\text{Average},\]</span></p>
<p>which happened to be 1.84 years here. We will compare this result to the results
for the test statistic that we obtain from permuting the group labels. To
denote permuted results, we will add a * to the labels:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T^*=\bar{x}_{\text{Unattractive}^*}-\bar{x}_{\text{Average}^*}.\]</span></p>
<p>We then compare the <span class="math inline">\(T_{obs}=\bar{x}_\text{Unattractive}-\bar{x}_\text{Average} = 1.84\)</span>
to the distribution of results that are possible for the permuted results (<span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span>)
which corresponds to assuming the null hypothesis is true.</p>
<p>We need to consider lots of permutations to do a permutation test.

In contrast to
your introductory statistics course where, if you did this, it was just a click
away, we are going to learn what was going on under the hood. Specifically, we
need a <strong><em>for loop</em></strong> in R to be able to repeatedly generate the permuted data
sets and record <span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span> for each one. Loops are a basic programming task that make
randomization methods possible as well as potentially simplifying any repetitive
computing task. To write a “for loop”, we need to choose how many times we want
to do the loop (call that <code>B</code>) and decide on a counter to keep track of where
we are at in the loops (call that <code>b</code>, which goes from 1 up to <code>B</code>). The
simplest loop just involves printing out the index, <code>print(b)</code> at each step.
This is our first use of curly braces, { and}, that are used to group the code
we want to repeatedly run as we proceed through the loop. By typing the following
code in the script window and then highlighting it all and hitting the run button,
R will go through the loop 5 times, printing out the counter:</p>
<pre><code>B &lt;- 5
for (b in (1:B)){
  print(b)
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that when you highlight and run the code, it will look about the same with
“+” printed after the first line to indicate that all the code is connected when
it appears in the console, looking like this:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="op">&gt;</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="cf">for</span>(b <span class="cf">in</span> (<span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span>B)){
<span class="op">+</span><span class="st">   </span><span class="kw">print</span>(b)
<span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span>}</code></pre>
<p>When you run these three lines of code, the console will show you the following
output:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">[<span class="dv">1</span>] <span class="dv">1</span>
[<span class="dv">1</span>] <span class="dv">2</span>
[<span class="dv">1</span>] <span class="dv">3</span>
[<span class="dv">1</span>] <span class="dv">4</span>
[<span class="dv">1</span>] <span class="dv">5</span></code></pre>
<p>Instead of printing the counter, we want to use the loop to repeatedly compute
our test statistic across B random permutations of the observations. The
<code>shuffle</code> function performs permutations of the group labels relative to
responses and the <code>diffmean</code> difference in the two group means in the permuted
data set. For a single permutation, the combination of shuffling <code>Attr</code> and
finding the difference in the means, storing it in a variable called <code>Ts</code> is:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">Ts &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">diffmean</span>(Years<span class="op">~</span><span class="kw">shuffle</span>(Attr), <span class="dt">data=</span>MockJury2)
Ts</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  diffmean 
## -0.616643</code></pre>
<p>And putting this inside the <code>print</code> function allows us to find the test
statistic under 5 different permutations easily:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">B &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">5</span>
<span class="cf">for</span> (b <span class="cf">in</span> (<span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span>B)){
  Ts &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">diffmean</span>(Years<span class="op">~</span><span class="kw">shuffle</span>(Attr), <span class="dt">data=</span>MockJury2)
  <span class="kw">print</span>(Ts)
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   diffmean 
## -0.8300142 
##   diffmean 
## -0.1365576 
##    diffmean 
## -0.08321479 
##  diffmean 
## 0.5035562 
## diffmean 
## 1.677098</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we would like to store the values of the test statistic instead of
just printing them out on each pass through the loop. To do this, we need to
create a variable to store the results, let’s call it <code>Tstar</code>. We know that
we need to store <code>B</code> results so will create a vector<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> of length B, which
contains B elements, full of missing values (NA) using the <code>matrix</code> function with the <code>nrow</code> option specifying the number of elements:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">Tstar &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">matrix</span>(<span class="ot">NA</span>, <span class="dt">nrow=</span>B)

<pre><code>##      [,1]
## [1,]   NA
## [2,]   NA
## [3,]   NA
## [4,]   NA
## [5,]   NA</code></pre>
<p>Now we can run our loop B times and store the results in <code>Tstar</code>.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="cf">for</span> (b <span class="cf">in</span> (<span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span>B)){

<p>Five permutations are still not enough to assess whether our <span class="math inline">\(T_{obs}\)</span>
of 1.84 is unusual and we need to do many permutations to get an accurate
assessment of the possibilities under the null hypothesis.

It is common practice
to consider something like 1,000 permutations. The <code>Tstar</code> vector when we set
<em>B</em> to be large, say <code>B=1000</code>, contains the permutation distribution  for the
selected test statistic under<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> the null
hypothesis – what is called the <strong><em>null distribution</em></strong> of the statistic. The
null distribution is the distribution of possible values of a statistic
under the null hypothesis. We want to visualize this distribution and use it to
assess how unusual our <span class="math inline">\(T_{obs}\)</span> result of 1.84 years was relative to all the
possibilities under permutations (under the null hypothesis). So we repeat the
loop, now with <span class="math inline">\(B=1000\)</span> and generate a histogram, density curve, and summary
statistics of the results:</p>

<p>Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-9">2.9</a> contains visualizations of <span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span> and the <code>favstats</code>

14 <span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span> values over 2 based on the
histogram. We need to make more specific comparisons of the permuted results
versus our observed result to be able to clearly decide whether our observed

<p>To make the comparisons more concrete, first we can enhance the previous graphs
by adding the value of the test statistic from the real data set, as shown in
Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-10">2.10</a>, using the <code>abline</code> function to draw a vertical

<p>Second, we can calculate the exact number of permuted results that were as
large or larger
than what we observed. To calculate the proportion of the 1,000 values that were
as large or larger than what we observed, we will use the <code>pdata</code> function.

To use this
function, we need to provide the distribution of values to compare to the cut-off
(<code>Tstar</code>), the cut-off point (<code>Tobs</code>), and whether we want calculate the
proportion that are below (left of) or above (right of) the cut-off
(<code>lower.tail=F</code> option provides the proportion of values above the cutoff
of interest).</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">pdata</span>(Tstar, Tobs, <span class="dt">lower.tail=</span>F)[[<span class="dv">1</span>]]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.02</code></pre>
<p>The proportion of 0.02 tells us that 20 of the 1,000 permuted results
(2%) were as large or larger than what we observed. This type of
work is how we can
generate <strong><em>p-values</em></strong> using permutation distributions.


P-values,

as you should
remember, are the probability of getting a result as extreme as or more extreme
than what we observed, <span class="math inline">\(\underline{\text{given that the null is true}}\)</span>. Finding
only 20
permutations of 1,000 that were larger than our observed result suggests that it
is hard to find a result like what we observed if there really were no difference,
although it is not impossible.</p>
<p>When testing hypotheses for two groups, there are two types of alternative
hypotheses, one-sided or two-sided. <strong><em>One-sided tests</em></strong> involve only considering
differences in one-direction (like <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 &gt; \mu_2\)</span>) and are performed when
researchers can decide <strong><em>a priori</em></strong><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> which group should have a larger mean
if there is going to be any sort of difference. In this situation, we did not
know enough about the potential impacts of the pictures to know which group should
be larger than the other so should do a two-sided test. It is important to
remember that you can’t look at the responses to decide on the hypotheses. It is
often safer and more <strong><em>conservative</em></strong><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> to start with a
<strong><em>two-sided alternative</em></strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{H_A: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2}\)</span>). To do a 2-sided
test, find the area larger than what we observed as above. We also need to add
the area in the other tail (here the left tail) similar to what we observed in the
right tail. Some people suggest doubling the area in one tail but we will collect
information on the number that were more as or more extreme than the same
value in the other
tail. In other words, we count the proportion over 1.84 and below -1.84. So
we need to also find how many of the permuted results were smaller than or equal
to -1.84 years
to add to our previous proportion. Using <code>pdata</code> with <code>-Tobs</code> as the cut-off
and <code>lower.tail=T</code> provides this result:
</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">pdata</span>(Tstar, <span class="op">-</span>Tobs, <span class="dt">lower.tail=</span>T)[[<span class="dv">1</span>]]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.014</code></pre>
<p>So the p-value to test our null hypothesis of no difference in the true means
between the groups is 0.02 + 0.014, providing a p-value of 0.034.

<p>In general, the <strong><em>one-sided test p-value</em></strong>

is the proportion of the
permuted results that are as extreme or more extreme than observed in the
direction of the <em>alternative</em>
hypothesis (lower or upper tail, remembering that this also depends on the
direction of the difference taken). For the 2-sided test, the p-value

is the
proportion of the permuted results that are <em>less than or equal to the negative
version of the observed statistic and greater than or equal to the positive
version of the observed statistic</em>. Using absolute
values (| |), we can simplify this: the <strong><em>two-sided p-value</em></strong> is the
<em>proportion of the |permuted statistics| that are as large or larger than
|observed statistic|</em>.
This will always work and finds areas in both tails regardless of whether the
observed statistic is positive or negative. In R, the <code>abs</code> function provides the
<strong><em>absolute value</em></strong> and we can again use <code>pdata</code> to find our p-value in one line
of code:
</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">pdata</span>(<span class="kw">abs</span>(Tstar), <span class="kw">abs</span>(Tobs), <span class="dt">lower.tail=</span>F)[[<span class="dv">1</span>]]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.034</code></pre>
<p>We will encourage you to think through what might constitute strong evidence
against your null hypotheses and then discuss how strong you feel the evidence
is against the null hypothesis in the p-value that you obtained. Basically,
p-values present a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis,

with smaller
values presenting more evidence against the null. They range from 0 to 1 and you
should interpret them on a graded scale from strong evidence (close to 0) to no
evidence (close 1). We will discuss the use of a fixed <strong><em>significance level</em></strong>
below as it is still commonly used in many fields and is necessary to think
about the theory of hypothesis testing, but, for the moment,
we can conclude that there is moderate evidence against the null hypothesis
presented by having a p-value of 0.034 because our observed result is somewhat
rare relative to what we would expect if the null hypothesis was true. And so
we would likely <strong><em>reject the null hypothesis</em></strong> and conclude (in the direction
of the alternative) that there is a difference in the population means in the
two groups.</p>
<p>Before we move on, let’s note some interesting features of the permutation
distribution of the difference in the sample means shown in
Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-11">2.11</a>. </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>It is basically centered at 0. Since we are performing permutations assuming
the null model is true, we are assuming that <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 = \mu_2\)</span> which implies that
<span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0\)</span>. This also suggests that 0 should be the center of the
permutation distribution and it was.</p></li>
<li><p>It is approximately normally distributed. This is due to the <strong><em>Central Limit Theorem</em></strong><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>, where the
<strong><em>sampling distribution</em></strong> (distribution of all possible results for samples
of this size) of the difference in sample means (<span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2\)</span>) becomes
more normally distributed as the sample sizes increase. With 38 and 37
observations in the groups, we are likely to have a relatively normal looking
distribution of the difference in the sample means. This result will allow us to
use a parametric

method to approximate this sampling distribution under the null
model if some assumptions are met, as we’ll discuss below.</p></li>
<li><p>Our observed difference in the sample means (1.84 years) is a fairly unusual
result relative to the rest of these results but there are some permuted data
sets that produce more extreme differences in the sample means. When the
observed differences are really large, we may not see any permuted results
that are as extreme as what we observed. When <code>pdata</code> gives you 0, the p-value

should be reported to be smaller than 0.0001 (<strong>not 0!</strong>) since it happened
in less than 1 in 1,000 tries but does occur once – in the actual data set.</p></li>
<li><p>Since our null model is not specific about the direction of the difference,
considering a result like ours but in the other direction (-1.84 years) needs to
be included. The observed result seems to put about the same area in both tails
of the distribution but it is not exactly the same. The small difference in the
tails is a useful aspect of this approach compared to the parametric method
discussed below as it accounts for potential asymmetry in the sampling distribution.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Earlier, we decided that the p-value provided moderate evidence against
the null hypothesis and that we should reject the null. In this
course, you will often be allowed to use your own judgment about an appropriate
significance level in a particular situation (in other words, if we forget to
tell you an <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> -level, you can still make a decision based on how strong
you feel the evidence was against the null based on the p-value). Remembering
that the p-value is the probability

you would observe a result like you did (or more extreme), assuming the null
hypothesis is true; this tells you that the smaller the p-value is, the more
evidence you have against the null. Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:FigurePValStr">2.12</a> provides a
diagram of some suggestions for the graded p-value interpretation that you can
use. The next section provides a more formal
review of the hypothesis testing

infrastructure, terminology, and some of
things that can happen when testing hypotheses. P-values have been (validly)

criticized for the inability of studies to be reproduced, for the bias in
publications to only include studies that have small p-values, and for the lack of
thought that often accompanies using a fixed significance level. To alleviate
some of these criticisms, we recommend reporting the strength of evidence of the
result based on the p-value and also reporting and discussing the size of the
estimated results (with a measure of precision of the estimated difference).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Hypothesis testing (general)</h2>
<p>In hypothesis testing

(sometimes more explicitly called “Null Hypothesis
Significance Testing” or NHST), it is formulated to answer a specific question about
a population or true parameter(s) using a statistic based on a data set.
In your previous statistics course, you (hopefully) considered one-sample
hypotheses about population means and proportions and the two sample mean
situation we are focused on here. Our hypotheses relate to trying to answer
the question about whether the population mean sentences between the two
groups are different, with an initial assumption of no difference.</p>
<p>NHST is much like a criminal trial with a jury where you are in the role
of a jury member. Initially, the defendant
is assumed innocent. In our situation, the true means are assumed to be
equal between the groups. Then evidence is presented and, as a juror,
you analyze it. In statistical hypothesis testing,

data are collected and
analyzed. Then you have to decide if we had “enough” evidence to reject
the initial assumption (“innocence” that is initially assumed). To make
this decision, you want to have thought about and decided on the standard of
evidence required to reject the initial assumption. In criminal cases,
“beyond a reasonable doubt” is used. Wikipedia’s definition
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt</a>) suggests that this
standard is that “there can still be a doubt, but only to the extent
that it would not affect a reasonable person’s belief regarding whether
or not the defendant is guilty”. In civil trials, a lower standard called
a “preponderance of evidence” is used. Based on that defined and pre-decided
(<em>a priori</em>) measure, you decide that the defendant is guilty or not guilty.
In statistics, we can compare our p-value

to a significance level, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>,
which is most of the time selected to be 5%. If our p-value is less than
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, we reject the null hypothesis. The choice of the significance level
is like the variation in standards of evidence between criminal and civil
trials – and in all situations everyone should know the standards required
for rejecting the initial assumption before any information is “analyzed”.
Once someone is found guilty, then there is the matter of sentencing which
is related to the impacts (“size”) of the crime. In statistics, this is
similar to the estimated size of differences and the related judgments
about whether the differences are practically important or not. If the
crime is proven beyond a reasonable doubt but it is a minor crime, then
the sentence will be small. With the same level of evidence and a more
serious crime, the sentence will be more dramatic.</p>
<p>There are some important aspects of the testing process to note that inform
how we interpret statistical hypothesis test results. When someone is found
“not guilty”, it does not mean “innocent”, it just means that there was not
enough evidence to find the person guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt”.
Not finding enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis does not imply
that the true means are equal, just that there was not enough evidence to
conclude that they were different. There are many potential reasons why we
might fail to reject the null, but the most common one is that our sample
size was too small (which is related to having too little evidence). Other
reasons include simply the variation in taking a random sample  from the
population(s). This randomness in samples and the differences in the sample
means also implies that p-values are random and can easily vary if the data set
had been slightly different. This also relates to the suggestion of using a
graded interpretation of p-values – if the p-value is an estimated quantity,
is there really any difference between p-values of 0.049 and 0.051? We
probably shouldn’t think there is a big difference in results for these two
p-values even though the standard NHST reject/fail to reject the null approach
considers these as completely different results. So where does that leave us?
Interpret the p-values

using strength of evidence against the null hypothesis,
remembering that smaller (but not really small) p-values can still be
interesting. And if you think the p-value is small enough, then you can reject
the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>Throughout this material, we will continue to re-iterate the distinctions
between parameters and statistics and want you to be clear about the
distinctions between estimates based on the sample and inferences for the
population or true values of the parameters of interest. Remember that
statistics are summaries of the sample information and parameters are
characteristics of populations (which we rarely know). In the two-sample
mean situation, the sample means are always at least a little different
– that is not an interesting conclusion. What is interesting is whether
we have enough evidence to feel like we have proven that the population or true means
differ “beyond a reasonable doubt”.</p>
<p>The scope of any inferences is constrained based on whether there is a
<strong><em>random sample</em></strong> (RS) and/or <strong><em>random assignment</em></strong> (RA).   
Table <a href="chapter2.html#tab:Table2-2">2.2</a> contains the four possible combinations of these
two characteristics of a given study. Random assignment of treatment levels to
subjects allows for causal
inferences for differences that are observed – the difference in treatment
levels is said to cause differences in the mean responses. Random sampling (or
at least some sort of representative sample) allows inferences to be made to
the population of interest. If we do not have RA, then causal inferences cannot
be made. If we do not have a representative sample, then our inferences are
limited to the sampled subjects.

<p>A simple example helps to clarify how the scope of inference can change
based on the study design.  Suppose
we are interested in studying the GPA of students. If we had taken a random
sample from, say, the STAT 217 students in a given semester, our scope of
inference would be the population of STAT 217 students in that semester. If we had
taken a random sample  from the entire MSU population, then the inferences would
be to the entire MSU population in that semester. These are similar types of
problems but the two populations are very different and the group you are trying
to make conclusions about should be noted carefully in your results – it does
matter! If we did not have a representative sample, say the students could
choose to provide this information or not, then we can only make inferences to
volunteers. These volunteers might differ in systematic ways from the entire
population of STAT 217 students so we cannot safely extend our inferences beyond
the group that volunteered.</p>
<p>To consider the impacts of RA versus results from purely observational
studies, we need to be
comparing groups. Suppose that we are interested in differences in the mean
GPAs for different sections of STAT 217 and that we take a random sample  of
students from each section and compare the results and find evidence of some
difference. In this scenario, we can conclude that there is some difference in
the population of STAT 217 students but we can’t say that being in different
sections caused the differences in the mean GPAs. Now suppose that we randomly
assigned every STAT 217 student to get extra training in one of three different
study techniques and found evidence of differences among the training methods.
We could conclude that the training methods caused the differences in these
students. These conclusions would only apply to STAT 217 students and could
not be generalized to a larger population of students. If we took a random
sample of STAT 217 students (say only 10 from each section) and then randomly
assigned them to one of three training programs and found evidence of
differences, then we can say that the training programs caused the differences.
But we can also say that we have evidence that those differences pertain to the
population of STAT 217 students. This seems similar to the scenario where all
STAT 217 students participated in the training programs except that by using random
sampling, only a fraction of the population needs to actually be studied to
make inferences to the entire population of interest – saving time and money.</p>
<p>A quick summary of the terminology of hypothesis testing

is useful at this
point. The <strong><em>null hypothesis</em></strong> (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) states that there is no difference
or no relationship in the population. This is the statement of no effect or
no difference and the claim that we are trying to find evidence against. In
this chapter, <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1=\mu_2\)</span>. When doing two-group problems, you
always need to specify which group is 1 and which one is 2 because the order
does matter. The <strong><em>alternative hypothesis</em></strong> (<span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span>) states a
specific difference between parameters. This is the research hypothesis and
the claim about the population that we hope to demonstrate is more reasonable
to conclude than the null hypothesis. In the two-group situation, we can have
<strong><em>one-sided alternatives</em></strong> <span class="math inline">\(H_A: \mu_1 &gt; \mu_2\)</span> (greater than) or
<span class="math inline">\(H_A: \mu_1 &lt; \mu_2\)</span> (less than) or, the more common, <strong><em>two-sided
alternative</em></strong> <span class="math inline">\(H_A: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2\)</span> (not equal to). We usually default to
using two-sided tests because we often do not know enough to know the
direction of a difference in advance, especially in more complicated
situations. The <strong><em>sampling distribution under the null</em></strong> is the
distribution of all possible values of a statistic under the assumption that
<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is true. It
is used to calculate the <strong><em>p-value</em></strong>,

the probability of obtaining a
result as extreme or more extreme than what we observed given that the null
hypothesis is true. We will find sampling distributions

using
<strong><em>nonparametric</em></strong>

approaches (like the permutation  approach used previously)
and <strong><em>parametric</em></strong>

methods (using “named” distributions like the
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, F, and <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>).</p>
<p>Small p-values are evidence against the null hypothesis

because the observed
result is unlikely due to chance if <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is true. Large p-values provide
little to no evidence against <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> but do not allow us to conclude that the null
hypothesis is correct – just that we didn’t find enough evidence to think it
was wrong. The <strong><em>level of significance</em></strong> is an <em>a priori</em> definition of
how small the p-value needs to be to provide “enough” (sufficient) evidence
against <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. This is most useful to prevent sliding the standards after
the results are found. We can compare the p-value to the level of significance to
decide if the p-value is small enough to constitute sufficient evidence to
reject the null hypothesis. We use <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> to denote the level of
significance and most typically use 0.05 which we refer to as the 5%
significance level. We can compare the p-value to this level and make a
decision, focusing our interpretation on the strength of evidence we found
based on the p-value from very strong to none.
If we are using the strict version of NHST, the two options for <em>decisions</em> are
to either <em>reject the null hypothesis</em>
if the p-value <span class="math inline">\(\le \alpha\)</span> or <em>fail to reject the null hypothesis</em> if the
p-value <span class="math inline">\(&gt; \alpha\)</span>. When interpreting hypothesis testing results, remember
that the p-value is a measure of how unlikely the observed outcome was,
assuming that the null hypothesis is true. It is <strong>NOT</strong> the probability of
the data or the probability of either hypothesis being true. The p-value,
simply, is a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>Although we want to use graded evidence to interpret p-values, there
is one situation where thinking about comparisons to fixed <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> levels is
useful for understanding and studying statistical hypothesis testing. The
specific definition of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is that it is the probability of rejecting
<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is true, the probability of what is called a
<strong><em>Type I error</em></strong>.  Type I errors are also called <strong><em>false rejections</em></strong> or
<strong><em>false detections</em></strong>. In the two-group mean situation, a Type I error would
be concluding that there
is a difference in the true means between the groups when none really exists
in the population. In the courtroom setting, this is like falsely finding
someone guilty. We don’t want to do this very often, so we use small values
of the significance level, allowing us to control the rate of Type I errors
at <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.  We also have to worry about <strong>Type II errors</strong>,  which are failing
to reject the null hypothesis when it’s false. In a courtroom, this is the same
as failing to convict a truly guilty person. This most often occurs due to a
lack of evidence that could be due to a small sample size or merely just an
unusual sample from the population. You can use the Table <a href="chapter2.html#tab:Table2-3">2.3</a>
to help you remember all the possibilities.</p>

<p>In comparing different procedures or in planning studies, there is an
interest in studying the rate or
probability of Type I and II errors. The probability of a Type I error was
defined previously as <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, the significance level. The <strong><em>power</em></strong> of a
procedure is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.   
Power is defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Power} = 1 - \text{Probability(Type II error) } = 
\text{Probability(Reject } H_0 | H_0 \text{ is false),}\]</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>or, in words, the probability of detecting a difference when it actually
exists. We want to use a statistical procedure that controls the Type I error
rate at the pre-specified level and has high power to detect false null
hypotheses. Increasing the sample size is one of the most commonly used
methods for increasing the power  in a given situation. Sometimes we can choose
among different procedures and use the power of the procedures to help us make
that selection. Note that there are many ways <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> false and the power changes
based on how false the null hypothesis actually is. To make this concrete,
suppose that the true mean sentences differed by either 1 or 20 years in
previous example. The chances of rejecting the null hypothesis are much larger
when the groups actually differ by 20 years than if they differ by just 1 year,
given the same sample size. For a given difference in the true means, the larger
the sample, the higher the power  of the study to actually find evidence of a
difference in the groups.</p>
<p>After making a decision (was there enough evidence to reject the null
or not), we want to make the conclusions specific to the problem of interest.
If we reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>, then we can conclude that there was sufficient evidence at
the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-level that the null hypothesis is wrong (and the results point in
the direction of the alternative). If we fail to reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> (FTR <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>), then
we can conclude that there was insufficient evidence at the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-level to say
that the null hypothesis is wrong. We are <strong>NOT</strong> saying that the null is
correct and we <strong>NEVER</strong> accept the null hypothesis. We just failed to find
enough evidence to say it’s wrong. If we find sufficient evidence to reject the
null, then we need to revisit the method of data collection and design of the
study to discuss scope of inference.  Can we discuss causality (due to RA) and/or
make inferences to a larger group than those in the sample (due to RS)?</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Connecting randomization (nonparametric) and parametric tests</h2>
<p>In developing statistical inference techniques, we need to define the test
statistic, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, that measures the quantity of interest. To compare the means of
two groups, a statistic is needed
that measures their differences. In general, for comparing two groups, the
choices are simple – a difference in the means often works well and is a
natural choice. There are other options such as tracking the ratio of means or
possibly the difference in medians. Instead of just using the difference in the
means, we also could “standardize” the difference in the means by dividing by
an appropriate quantity that reflects the variation in the difference in the
means. All of these are valid and can sometimes provide similar results - it
ends up that there are many possibilities for testing using the randomization
(nonparametric)

techniques introduced previously. Parametric

statistical
methods focus on means because the statistical theory surrounding means is
quite a bit easier (not easy, just easier) than other options but there are
just a couple of test statistics that you can use and end up with named
distributions to use for generating inferences. Randomization techniques allow
inference for other quantities but our focus here will be on using
randomization for inferences on means to see the similarities with the more
traditional parametric procedures.</p>
<p>In two-sample mean situations, instead of working just with the
difference in the means, we often calculate a test statistic that is called the
<strong><em>equal variance two-independent samples t-statistic</em></strong>. The test statistic is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}},\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(s_1^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_2^2\)</span> are the sample variances for the two groups, <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> are the sample sizes for the two groups, and the
<strong><em>pooled sample standard deviation</em></strong>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}.\]</span></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic keeps the important comparison between the means in the
numerator that we used before and standardizes (re-scales) that difference so
that <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> will follow a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution

(a parametric

“named” distribution) if
certain assumptions are met. But first we should see if standardizing the
difference in the means had an impact on our permutation test

results. Instead
of using the <code>diffmean</code> function, we will use the <code>t.test</code> function (see
its full use below) and have it calculate the formula for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> for us. The R
code “<code>$statistic</code>” is basically a way of extracting just the number we want
to use for <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> from a larger set of output the <code>t.test</code> function wants to
provide you. We will see below that <code>t.test</code> switches the order of the
difference (now it is <em>Average</em> - <em>Unattractive</em>) – always carefully check for
the direction of the difference in the results. Since we are doing a two-sided
test, the code resembles the permutation test code in Section <a href="chapter2.html#section2-4">2.2</a>
with the new <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic replacing the difference in the sample means that we
used before.</p>
<p>The permutation distribution

in Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-12">2.13</a> looks
similar to the previous results with slightly different x-axis scaling. The
observed <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic was <span class="math inline">\(-2.17\)</span> and the proportion of permuted results that
were as or more extreme than the observed result
was 0.031. This difference is due to a different set of random permutations
being selected. If you run permutation code, you will often get slightly
different results each time you run it. If you are uncomfortable with the
variation in the results, you can run more than <span class="math inline">\(B=\)</span> 1,000 permutations (say
10,000) and the variability in the resulting p-values will be reduced further.
Usually this uncertainty will not cause any substantive problems – but do not
be surprised if your results vary from a colleagues if you are both analyzing
the same data set or if you re-run your permutation code.</p>

<p>The parametric version

of these results is based on using what is called
the <strong><em>two-independent sample t-test</em></strong>. There are actually two versions of this
test, one that assumes that variances are equal in the groups and one that
does not. There is a rule of thumb that if the <strong>ratio of the larger standard
deviation over the smaller standard deviation is less than 2, the equal variance
procedure is OK</strong>. It ends up that this assumption
is less important if the sample sizes in the groups are approximately equal
and more important if the groups contain different numbers of observations. In
comparing the two potential test statistics, the procedure that assumes equal
variances has a complicated denominator (see the formula above for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>
involving <span class="math inline">\(s_p\)</span>) but a simple formula for <strong><em>degrees of freedom</em></strong> (<strong><em>df</em></strong>)


for the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution (<span class="math inline">\(df=n_1+n_2-2\)</span>) that approximates the
distribution of the test statistic, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, under the null hypothesis. The
procedure that assumes unequal variances has a simpler test statistic and a
very complicated degrees of freedom formula. The equal variance procedure is
most similar to the ANOVA methods we will consider in Chapters
<a href="chapter3.html#chapter3">3</a> and <a href="chapter4.html#chapter4">4</a> so that
will be our focus for the two group problem. Fortunately, both of these methods
are readily available in the <code>t.test</code> function in R if needed.</p>
<p>(ref:fig2-13) Plots of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distributions with 2, 10, and 20 degrees of freedom
and a normal distribution (dashed line). Note how the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distributions get
closer to the normal distribution as the degrees of freedom increase and at 20
degrees of freedom, the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution <em>almost</em> matches a standard normal
curve.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:Figure2-13"></span>

</p>
</div>
<p>If the assumptions for the equal variance <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test are met and the null
hypothesis is true, then the sampling distribution of the test statistic should
follow a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution

with <span class="math inline">\(n_1+n_2-2\)</span> degrees of freedom. The <strong><em>t-distribution</em></strong> is a bell-shaped curve that is more spread out for smaller
values of degrees of freedom as shown in Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-13">2.14</a>. The
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution looks more and more like a <strong><em>standard normal distribution</em></strong>

(<span class="math inline">\(N(0,1)\)</span>) as the degrees of freedom increase.</p>
<p>To get the p-value for the parametric <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test,

we need to calculate the
test statistic and <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span>, then look up the areas in the tails of the
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution

relative to the observed <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic. We’ll learn how to use
R to do this below, but for now we will allow the <code>t.test</code> function to take
care of this. The <code>t.test</code> function uses our formula notation (<code>Years~Attr</code>)
and then <code>data=...</code> as we saw before for making plots. To get the
equal-variance test result, the <code>var.equal=T</code> option needs to be turned on.
Then <code>t.test</code> provides us with lots of useful output. The three results we’ve
been discussing are available in the output below – the test statistic value
(-2.17), <span class="math inline">\(df=73\)</span>, and the p-value, from the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution with 73 degrees of freedom, of 0.033.</p>

<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">t.test</span>(Years <span class="op">~</span><span class="st"> </span>Attr, <span class="dt">data=</span>MockJury2, <span class="dt">var.equal=</span>T)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  Years by Attr
## t = -2.1702, df = 73, p-value = 0.03324
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -3.5242237 -0.1500295
## sample estimates:

<p>So the parametric <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test gives a p-value of 0.033 from a test statistic of
-2.1702. The negative sign on the test statistic occurred because the function
took <em>Average</em> - <em>Unattractive</em> which is the opposite direction as <code>diffmean</code>.
The p-value is very similar to the two permutation results found before. The
reason for this similarity is that the permutation distribution looks an awful
like a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution with 73 degrees
of freedom. Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-14">2.15</a> shows how similar the two distributions
happened to be here.</p>
<p>(ref:fig2-14) Plot of permutation and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution with <span class="math inline">\(df=73\)</span>. Note the
close match in the two distributions, especially in the tails of the
distributions where we are obtaining the p-values.</p>

p-values<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> from

<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">pt</span>(<span class="op">-</span><span class="fl">2.1702</span>, <span class="dt">df=</span><span class="dv">73</span>, <span class="dt">lower.tail=</span>T)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.01662286</code></pre>
<p>And we can double it to get the p-value that <code>t.test</code> provided earlier, because
the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution is symmetric:
</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="dv">2</span><span class="op">*</span><span class="kw">pt</span>(<span class="op">-</span><span class="fl">2.1702</span>, <span class="dt">df=</span><span class="dv">73</span>, <span class="dt">lower.tail=</span>T)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.03324571</code></pre>
<p>More generally, we could always make the test statistic positive using the
absolute value (<code>abs</code>), find the area to the right of it (<code>lower.tail=F</code>), and then double that for a
two-sided test p-value:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="dv">2</span><span class="op">*</span><span class="kw">pt</span>(<span class="kw">abs</span>(<span class="op">-</span><span class="fl">2.1702</span>), <span class="dt">df=</span><span class="dv">73</span>, <span class="dt">lower.tail=</span>F)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.03324571</code></pre>
<p>Permutation distributions  do not need to match the named
parametric distribution

to work correctly, although this happened in the previous example.
The parametric approach, the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, requires certain conditions to be met
for the sampling distribution of the
statistic to follow the named distribution and provide accurate p-values. The
conditions for the equal variance t-test are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Independent observations</strong>:

Each observation obtained is unrelated to all other
observations. To assess this, consider whether anything in the data collection
might lead to clustered or related observations that are un-related to the
differences in the groups. For example, was the same person measured more than
once<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a>?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Equal variances</strong> in the groups (because we used a procedure that assumes
equal variances! – there is another procedure that allows you to relax this
assumption if needed…). To assess this, compare the standard deviations and
variability in the beanplots  and see if they look noticeably different. Be
particularly critical of this assessment if the sample sizes differ greatly
between groups.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Normal distributions</strong> of the observations in each group. We’ll learn more
diagnostics later, but the boxplots and beanplots are a good place to start to
help you look for skews or outliers, which were both present here. If you find
skew and/or outliers, that would suggest a problem with the assumption of
normality as normal distributions
  
are symmetric and extreme observations occur
very rarely.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For the permutation test,  we relax the third condition and replace it with:</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong><em>Similar distributions for the groups:</em></strong> The permutation approach
allows valid inferences as long as the two groups have similar shapes and only
possibly differ in their centers. In other words, the distributions need not
look normal for the procedure to work well, but they do need to look similar.
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the prisoner “juror” study, we can assume that the independent
observation condition is met because there is no information suggesting that
the same subjects were measured more than once or that some other type of
grouping in the responses was present (like the subjects were divided in
groups and placed in rooms to discuss their responses prior to submitting
them). The equal variance condition might be violated. The variances need
not be equal as the procedure
can still provide reasonable results with some violation of this assumption.
The standard deviations are 2.8 vs 4.4, so this difference is not “large”
according to the rule of thumb noted above. It is, however, close to being
considered problematic. It would be difficult to reasonably assume that the
normality condition is met here (Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-6">2.6</a>) with clear right
skews in both groups and potential outliers which causes concerns for (3) for
the parametric procedure. The shapes look similar for the two groups so there
is less reason to be concerned with using the permutation approach based on
its version of condition (3) above.</p>
<p>The permutation approach is resistant

to impacts of violations of the
normality assumption. It is not resistant to impacts of violations of any of
the other assumptions.

In fact, it can be quite sensitive to unequal variances
as it will detect differences in the variances of the groups instead of
differences in the means. Its scope of inference is the same as the parametric
approach.  It also can provide similarly inaccurate conclusions in the presence
of non-independent observations as for the parametric approach. In this
example, we discover that parametric and permutation approaches provide very
similar inferences.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Second example of permutation tests</h2>
<p>In every chapter, the first example, used to motivate and explain
the methods, is followed with a “worked” example where we focus just on the
results. In a
previous semester, some of the STAT 217 students (<strong><em>n</em></strong>=79) provided
information on their <em>Sex</em><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a>, <em>Age</em>, and current cumulative <em>GPA</em>. We might be
interested in whether Males and Females had different average GPAs. First,
we can take a look at the difference in the responses by groups based on the
output and as displayed in Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-15">2.16</a>.</p>

<p>In these data, the distributions of the GPAs look to be left skewed but maybe not
as dramatically as the responses were right-skewed in the MockJury example. The
Female GPAs look to be slightly higher than for Males (0.25 GPA difference in the
means) but is that a “real” difference? We need our inference tools to more fully
assess these differences.</p>

<pre><code>##   diffmean 
## -0.2498069</code></pre>
<p>First, we can try the parametric approach:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">t.test</span>(GPA<span class="op">~</span>Sex, <span class="dt">data=</span>s217, <span class="dt">var.equal=</span>T)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  GPA by Sex
## t = 2.6919, df = 77, p-value = 0.008713
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  0.06501838 0.43459552
## sample estimates:
## mean in group F mean in group M 
##        3.338378        3.088571</code></pre>
<p>So the test statistic was observed to be <span class="math inline">\(t=2.69\)</span> and it hopefully
follows a <span class="math inline">\(t(77)\)</span> distribution under the null hypothesis. This provides a
p-value of 0.008713 that we can trust if all the conditions to use this

Compare these results to the permutation approach, which relaxes that normality

the p-value is 0.005 which is a little smaller than the result provided

some re-assurance about the use of either approach. </p>

<p>Here is a full write-up of the results using all 6+ hypothesis testing

steps,
using the permutation  results for the grade data:</p>
<ol start="0" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>Isolate the claim to be proved and method to use (define a test statistic T)</em>.
We want to test for a difference in the means between males and females and
will use the equal variance two-sample t-test statistic to compare them, and
we think that the 5% significance level seems reasonable in this situation.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the null and alternative hypotheses</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(H_0: \mu_\text{male} = \mu_\text{female}\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>where <span class="math inline">\(\mu_\text{male}\)</span> is the true mean GPA for males and
<span class="math inline">\(\mu_\text{female}\)</span> is true mean GPA for females.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(H_A: \mu_\text{male} \ne \mu_\text{female}\)</span></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Check conditions for the procedure being used</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Independent observations condition</strong>: It appears that this assumption
is met because there is no reason to assume any clustering or grouping of
responses that might create dependence in the observations. The only
possible consideration is that the observations were taken from different
sections and there could be some differences between the sections. However,
for overall GPA there is not too much likelihood that the overall GPAs
would vary greatly so this not likely to be a big issue. The only way this
could create a violation here is if certain sections tended to attract
students with different GPA levels (such as the 9 am section had the
best/worst GPA students…).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Equal variance condition</strong>: There is a small difference in the range
of the observations in the two groups but the standard deviations are very
similar so there is effectively no evidence that this condition is violated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Similar distribution condition</strong>: Based on the side-by-side boxplots and
beanplots, it appears that both groups have slightly left-skewed
distributions, which could be problematic for the parametric approach, but
there is essentially no evidence that the permutation approach condition is violated
since the distributions look to have fairly similar shapes.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Find the value of the appropriate test statistic</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(T=2.69\)</span> from the previous R output.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Find the p-value</p>
<ul>
<li><p>p-value=0.005 from the permutation distribution results.</p></li>
<li><p>This means that there is about a 0.5% chance we would observe
a difference in mean GPA (female-male or male-female) of 0.25 points or more
if there in fact is no difference in true mean GPA between females and males
in STAT 217 in a particular semester.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Decision</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the p-value is “small”, we find strong evidence against the null
hypothesis and can reject the null hypothesis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Conclusion and scope of inference, specific to the problem </p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference
in the true mean GPA between males and females for the STAT 217 students
in this semester and so we conclude that there is evidence of a difference
in the mean GPAs between males and females in STAT 217 students.</p></li>
<li><p>Because this was not a randomized experiment, we can’t say that the
difference in sex causes the difference in mean GPA and because it was
not a random sample from a larger population, our inferences only pertain
the STAT 217 students that responded to the survey in that semester. </p></li>
<li><p>Females were estimated to have a higher mean GPA by 0.25 points. The next
section discusses confidence intervals that we could add to this result to
quantify the uncertainty in this estimate.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Confidence intervals and bootstrapping</h2>
<p>Randomly shuffling the treatments between the observations is like randomly
sampling the treatments without replacement. In other words, we randomly
sample one observation at a time from the treatments until we have <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
observations. This provides us with a technique
for testing hypotheses because it provides new splits of the observations
into groups that are as interesting as what we observed if the null hypothesis
is assumed true. In most situations, we also want to estimate parameters of
interest and provide <strong><em>confidence intervals</em></strong> for those parameters (an
interval where we are __% <strong><em>confident</em></strong> that the true parameter lies). As
before, there are two options we will consider – a parametric  and a
nonparametric approach. The nonparametric 
approach will be using what is
called <strong><em>bootstrapping</em></strong>

and draws its name from “pull yourself up by
your bootstraps” where you improve your situation based on your own efforts.
In statistics, we make our situation or inferences better by re-using the
observations we have by assuming that the sample represents the population.
Since each observation represents other similar observations in the
population that we didn’t get to measure, if we <strong><em>sample with replacement</em></strong>
to generate a new data set of size <em>n</em> from our data set (also of size <em>n</em>)
it mimics the process of taking repeated random samples  of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> from our
population of interest. This process also
ends up giving us useful sampling distributions

of statistics even when our
standard normality assumption is violated, similar to what we encountered
in the permutation tests. Bootstrapping is especially useful in situations
where we are interested in statistics other than the mean (say we want a
confidence interval for a median or a standard deviation) or when we consider
functions of more than one parameter and don’t want to derive the distribution
of the statistic (say the difference in two medians). In this text,
bootstrapping is used to provide more trustworthy inferences when some of our
assumptions (especially normality) might be violated for our parametric procedure.
</p>
<p>To perform bootstrapping, we will use the <code>resample</code> function from the
<code>mosaic</code> package. We can apply this function to a data set and get a new
version of the
data set by sampling new observations <em>with replacement</em> from the original one.
The new, bootstrapped version of the data set (called <code>MockJury_BTS</code> below)
contains a new variable called <code>orig.id</code> which is the number of the subject
from the original data set. By summarizing how often each of these id’s
occurred in a bootstrapped data set, we can see how the re-sampling works.
The <code>table</code> function will count up how many times each observation was used in
the bootstrap sample,

providing a row with the id followed by a row with the
count<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a>. In the first bootstrap
sample shown, the 1<sup>st</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, and 10<sup>th</sup> observations
were sampled one time each, the 5<sup>th</sup> observation was sampled three
times, and the 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, and many others
were not sampled at all. Bootstrap sampling thus picks some observations
multiple times and to do that it has to ignore some<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> observations.</p>

<p>Like in permutations, one randomization isn’t enough. A second bootstrap sample
is also provided to help you get a sense of what bootstrap data sets contain.
It did not select subject 7 but did select 6, 14, and 21 more than once.
You can see other variations in the resulting re-sampling of subjects with the
most sampled subjects 6 and 50 sampled four times. With <span class="math inline">\(n=75\)</span>, the the chance of
selecting any observation for any slot
in the new data set is <span class="math inline">\(1/75\)</span> and the expected or mean number of appearances we

<p>We can use the two results to get an idea of distribution of results in terms
of number of times observations might be re-sampled when sampling with
replacement and the variation in those results, as shown in
Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-17">2.18</a>. We could also derive the expected counts for
each number of times of re-sampling when we start with all observations having
an equal chance and sampling with replacement but this isn’t important for
using bootstrapping methods.</p>

<p>The main point of this exploration was to see that each run of the
<code>resample</code> function provides a new version of the data set. Repeating this
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> times using
another <code>for</code> loop, we will track our quantity of interest, say <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, in all
these new “data sets” and call those results <span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span>. The distribution of the
bootstrapped

<span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span> statistics will tell us about the range of results to expect
for the statistic and the middle __% of the <span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span>’s provides a
<strong><em>bootstrap confidence interval</em></strong><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> for the true parameter – here the <em>difference in the two population means</em>.</p>
<p>To make this concrete, we can revisit our previous examples, starting
with the <code>MockJury2</code> data created before and our interest in comparing the
mean sentences for the <em>Average</em> and <em>Unattractive</em> picture groups. The
bootstrapping code is very similar to the permutation code except that we apply
the <code>resample</code> function to the entire data set as opposed to the <code>shuffle</code>
function that was applied only to the explanatory variable.</p>

<p>In this situation, the observed difference in the mean sentences is 1.84 years
(<em>Unattractive</em> - <em>Average</em>), which is the vertical line in Figure
<a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-18">2.19</a>.
The bootstrap distribution

shows the results for the difference in the sample
means when fake data sets are re-constructed by sampling from the original data set with
replacement. The bootstrap distribution is approximately centered at the observed
value (difference in the sample means) and is relatively symmetric.</p>
<p>The permutation distribution  in the same situation (Figure
<a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-12">2.13</a>) had a similar shape but was centered at 0.
Permutations create sampling
distributions

based on assuming the null hypothesis is true, which is useful for
hypothesis testing. Bootstrapping creates distributions centered at the observed
result, which is the sampling distribution “under the alternative” or when no null
hypothesis is assumed; bootstrap distributions are useful for generating
confidence intervals for the true parameter values.</p>
<p>To create a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the difference in
the true mean sentences (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_\text{Unattr}-\mu_\text{Avg}\)</span>), select the
middle 95% of results from
the bootstrap distribution. Specifically, find the 2.5<sup>th</sup>
percentile and the 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile (values that put 2.5 and 97.5%
of the results to the left) in the bootstrap distribution, which leaves 95% in
the middle for the confidence interval. To find percentiles in a distribution
in R, functions are of the form <code>q[Name of distribution]</code>, with the function
<code>qt</code> extracting percentiles from a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution (examples below). From the
bootstrap results, use the <code>qdata</code> function on the <code>Tstar</code> results that
contain the bootstrap distribution of the statistic of interest.</p>

<pre><code>##        p quantile

<p>These results tell us that the 2.5<sup>th</sup> percentile of the bootstrap
distribution is at 0.24 years and the 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile is at 3.52
years. We can combine these results to provide a 95% confidence for
<span class="math inline">\(\mu_\text{Unattr}-\mu_\text{Avg}\)</span> that is between 0.24 and 3.52 years. We can
interpret this
as with any confidence interval, that we are 95% confident that the difference
in the true mean suggested sentences (<em>Unattractive</em> minus <em>Average</em> groups) is
between 0.24 and 3.52 years. We can also obtain both percentiles in one line
of code using:</p>

<p>Although confidence intervals can exist without referencing hypotheses,
we can
revisit our previous hypotheses and see what this confidence interval tells
us about the test of <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \mu_\text{Unattr} = \mu_\text{Avg}\)</span>. This null
hypothesis is equivalent to testing <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \mu_\text{Unattr} - \mu_\text{Avg} = 0\)</span>,
that the difference
in the true means is equal to 0 years. And the difference in the means was the
scale for our confidence interval, which did not contain 0 years. We will call
0 an interesting <strong><em>reference value</em></strong> for the confidence interval, because
here it is the value where the true means are equal to each other (have a
difference of 0 years). In general, if our confidence interval does not contain
0, then it is saying that 0 is not one of our likely values for the difference
in the true means. This implies that we should reject a claim that they are
equal. This provides the same inferences for the hypotheses that we considered
previously using both a parametric and permutation approach.</p>
<p>The general summary
is that we can use confidence intervals to test hypotheses by assessing whether
the reference value under the null hypothesis is in the confidence interval
(FTR <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) or outside the confidence interval (Reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>). P-values

are more
informative about hypotheses (measure of evidence against the null hypothesis)
but confidence intervals are more informative
about the size of differences, so both offer useful information and, as shown
here, can provide consistent conclusions about hypotheses.</p>
<p>As in the previous situation, we also want to consider the parametric
approach
for comparison purposes and to have that method available, especially to help
us understand some methods where we will only consider parametric inferences
in later chapters. The parametric confidence interval is called the
<strong><em>equal variance, two-sample t confidence interval</em></strong> and additionally
assumes that the populations
being sampled from are normally distributed. It leads to using a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution

to form the interval. The output from the <code>t.test</code> function provides the
parametric 95% confidence interval calculated for you:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">t.test</span>(Years<span class="op">~</span>Attr, <span class="dt">data=</span>MockJury2, <span class="dt">var.equal=</span>T)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Two Sample t-test

##                   3.973684                   5.810811</code></pre>
<p>The <code>t.test</code> function again switched the order of the groups and provides
slightly different end-points than our bootstrap confidence interval (both are
made at the 95% confidence level though), which was slightly narrower. Both
intervals have the same interpretation, only the methods for calculating the
intervals and the assumptions differ. Specifically, the bootstrap interval can
tolerate different distribution shapes other than normal and still provide
intervals that work well<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a>. The other assumptions

are all the same as for the hypothesis
test, where we continue to assume that we have independent observations with
equal variances for the two groups.</p>
<p>The formula that <code>t.test</code> is using to calculate the parametric
<strong><em>equal variance two-sample t confidence interval</em></strong> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 \mp t^*_{df}s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}\]</span></p>
<p>In this situation, the <em>df</em> is again <span class="math inline">\(n_1+n_2-2\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(t^*_{df}\)</span> is
a multiplier that comes from finding the percentile from the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution
that puts <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>% in the middle of the distribution with <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> being the confidence
level. It is important to note that this <span class="math inline">\(t^*\)</span> has nothing to do with the previous
test statistic <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. It is confusing and many of you will, at some point, happily
take the result from a test statistic calculation and use it for a multiplier
in a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-based confidence interval. Figure <a href="chapter2.html#fig:Figure2-20">2.21</a> shows the
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution with 73 degrees of freedom and the cut-offs that put 95% of the
area in the middle.</p>
<p>(ref:fig2-20) Plot of <span class="math inline">\(t(73)\)</span> with cut-offs for putting 95% of distribution in
the middle.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>For 95% confidence intervals, the multiplier is going to be close to 2 and
anything else is a sign of a mistake. We can use R to get the multipliers for
confidence intervals using the <code>qt</code> function in a similar fashion to how
<code>qdata</code> was used in the bootstrap results, except that this new value must be
used in the previous confidence interval formula. This function produces values
for requested percentiles, so if we want to put 95% in the middle, we place
2.5% in each tail of the distribution and need to request the 97.5<sup>th</sup>
percentile. Because the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution is always symmetric around 0, we merely
need to look up the value for the 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile and know that the
multiplier for the 2.5<sup>th</sup> percentile is just <span class="math inline">\(-t^*\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(t^*\)</span>
multiplier to form the confidence interval is 1.993 for a 95% confidence interval
when the <span class="math inline">\(df=73\)</span> based on the results from <code>qt</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">qt</span>(<span class="fl">0.975</span>, <span class="dt">df=</span><span class="dv">73</span>)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1.992997</code></pre>
<p>Note that the 2.5<sup>th</sup> percentile is just the negative of this value due
to symmetry and the real source of the minus in the minus/plus in the formula
for the confidence interval.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">qt</span>(<span class="fl">0.025</span>, <span class="dt">df=</span><span class="dv">73</span>)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] -1.992997</code></pre>
<p>We can also re-write the confidence interval formula into a slightly more
general form as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 \mp t^*_{df}SE_{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}\ \text{ OR }\ 
\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 \mp ME\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(SE_{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2} = s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(ME = t^*_{df}SE_{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}\)</span>. In some situations, researchers will
report the <strong><em>standard error</em></strong> (SE) or <strong><em>margin of error</em></strong> (ME) as a method
of quantifying the uncertainty in a statistic. The SE is an estimate of the
standard deviation of the statistic (here <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2\)</span>) and the ME
is an estimate of the precision of a statistic that can be used to directly
form a confidence interval. The ME depends on the choice of confidence level
although 95% is almost always selected.</p>
<p>To finish this example, R can be used to help you do calculations much
like a calculator except with much more power “under the hood”.  You have to
make sure you are careful with using <code>( )</code> to group items and remember that
the asterisk (*) is used for multiplication in R. We need the pertinent
information which is available from the <code>favstats</code> output repeated below to
calculate the confidence interval “by hand”<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> using R.</p>

<p>As a review of some basic ideas with confidence intervals make sure
you can answer the following questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What is the impact of increasing the confidence level in this situation?</p></li>
<li><p>What happens to the width of the confidence interval if the size of the
SE increases or decreases?</p></li>
<li><p>What about increasing the sample size – should that increase or decrease
the width of the interval?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All the general results you learned before about impacts to widths of CIs hold
in this situation whether we are considering the parametric or bootstrap methods…</p>
<p>To finish this example, we will generate the comparable bootstrap 90%
confidence interval using the bootstrap distribution in

<p>In the previous output, the parametric 90% confidence interval is from
0.095 to 0.404, suggesting similar results again from the two approaches once
you account for the two different orders of differencing of the groups. Based on
the bootstrap CI, we can say that we are 90% confident that the difference in
the true mean GPAs for STAT 217 students is between -0.393 to -0.094 GPA points
(male minus females). Because sex cannot be assigned to the subjects, we cannot
infer that sex is causing this difference and because this was a voluntary
response sample of STAT 217 students in a given semester, we cannot infer that
a difference of this size would apply to all STAT 217 students or, certainly,
students this semester.</p>
<p>Throughout the text, pay attention to the distinctions between parameters
and statistics, focusing on the differences between estimates based on the sample
and inferences for the population of interest in the form of the parameters of
interest. Remember that statistics are summaries of the sample information and
parameters are characteristics of populations (which we rarely know). And that
our inferences are limited to the population that we randomly sampled from, if
we randomly sampled.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.8</span> Chapter summary</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we reviewed basic statistical inference methods in the context
of a two-sample mean problem. You were introduced to using R to do permutation
testing and generate bootstrap confidence intervals as well as obtaining
parametric <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test and confidence intervals in this same situation. You should
have learned how to use a <code>for</code> loop for doing the nonparametric inferences
and the <code>t.test</code> function for generating parametric inferences. In the two
examples considered, the parametric and nonparametric methods provided similar
results, suggesting that the assumptions were at least close to being met for
the parametric procedures. When parametric and nonparametric approaches
disagree, the nonparametric methods are likely to be more trustworthy since
they have less restrictive assumptions but can still have problems.
</p>
<p>When the noted conditions are not met in a hypothesis testing situation, the
Type I error  rates can be inflated, meaning that we reject the null hypothesis
more often than we have allowed to occur by chance. Specifically, we could have
a situation where our assumed 5% significance level test might actually reject
the null when it is true 20% of the time. If this is occurring, we call a
procedure <strong><em>liberal</em></strong> (it rejects too easily) and if the procedure is liberal,
how could we trust a small p-value to be a “real” result and not just an
artifact of violating the assumptions of the procedure? Likewise, for
confidence intervals we hope that our 95% confidence level procedure, when
repeated, will contain the true parameter 95% of the time. If our assumptions
are violated, we might actually have an 80% confidence level procedure and it
makes it hard to trust the reported results for our observed data set.
Statistical inference relies on a belief in the methods underlying our
inferences. If we don’t trust our assumptions, we shouldn’t trust the
conclusions to perform the way we want them to. As sample sizes increase
and/or violations of conditions lessen, then the procedures will perform better.
In Chapter <a href="chapter3.html#chapter3">3</a>, some new tools for doing diagnostics are introduced
to help us assess how much those validity conditions are violated.</p>

(you need to
install the <code>mosaicData</code> package once to be able to load it). The HELP study
was a clinical trial for adult inpatients recruited from a
detoxification unit. Patients with no primary care physician were randomly
assigned to receive a multidisciplinary assessment and a brief motivational
intervention or usual care and various outcomes were observed. Two of the
variables in the data set are <code>sex</code>, a factor with levels <em>male</em> and <em>female</em>
and <code>daysanysub</code> which is the time (in days) to first use of any substance
post-detox. We are interested in the difference in mean number of days to first
use of any substance post-detox between males and females. There are some
missing responses and the following code will produce <code>favstats</code> with the
missing values and then provide a data set that by
applying the <code>na.omit</code> function removes any observations with missing
values.

<p>2.1. Based on the results provided, how many observations were missing for males
and females? Missing values here likely mean that the subjects didn’t use any
substances post-detox in the time of the study but might have at a later
date – the study just didn’t run long enough. This is called <strong><em>censoring</em></strong>.
What is the problem with the numerical summaries here if the missing responses
were all something larger than the largest observation?</p>
<p>2.2. Make a beanplot and a boxplot of <code>daysanysub</code> ~ <code>sex</code> using the
<code>HELPrct3</code> data set created above. Compare the distributions, recommending
parametric or nonparametric inferences.</p>
<p>2.3. Generate the permutation results and write out the 6+ steps of the
hypothesis test, making sure to note the numerical value of observed test
statistic you are using and include a discussion of the scope of inference.</p>
<p>2.4. Interpret the p-value for these results.</p>
<p>2.5. Generate the parametric <code>t.test</code> results, reporting the test-statistic,
its distribution under the null hypothesis, and compare the p-value to those
observed using the permutation approach.</p>
<p>2.6. Make and interpret a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the difference
in the means.</p>
